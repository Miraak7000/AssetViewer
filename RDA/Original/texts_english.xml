Dr. Mercier wants you to increase the production of bread, and stock up on it. Hopefully he has a few tricks to make the stale loaves a little easier on the jaw...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110721</GUID><Text>You want to serve your community? Set them free? Make them self-sufficient, and no mogul will ever have power over them. They must produce all they require!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110722</GUID><Text>Hugo believes your workers will find fulfilment in working harder — much harder — to lift their community. Don't worry! It's not exploitation if the proceeds go to the workers. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>110723</GUID><Text>How it pains me to look at your soulless workers, wasting their spirits away like mindless drudges. Do you know what would give them far more zest than a cup of teeth-yellowing coffee? Working hard to serve their own needs and those of their community, instead of feeding a capitalist leech.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110724</GUID><Text>In a grand gesture to prove to you that his system works just fine, Hugo would like to donate a large amount of his extra stock to you. Sure, his people are perfectly fine with that...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110725</GUID><Text>Once you extract all the crooked incentives that have been fabricated by capitalism to hoard property, people only take as much as they need. We produce so much and gobble up so little, we can barely close our storeroom doors! Take as much as you need — think of it as a sample of what our system can achieve.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110726</GUID><Text>The word about Hugo Mercier's anarchist utopia has travelled far and wide, and reached the ears of a receptive crowd. People from all corners of the world are travelling to join his commune, and Hugo has asked you to grant them a safe passage.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110727</GUID><Text>I don't care who they are or where they come from — if the establishment has them squeezed under its heel, they will be welcomed in our utopia! We can't allow them to suffer any harm — please shelter them on their way to our open arms.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110728</GUID><Text>Goodbye, hunger! Goodbye, freezing nights out on the streets! So long, scornful glances from passers-by...! Hello, Dr. Hugo! Hello, Dr. Hugo! Hello, Dr. Hugo!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110730</GUID><Text>Hugo believes that humans are virtuous by nature when they are not forced to compete under the rules of capitalism. Dr. Harvey Sprucer, one of the heads of Social Darwinism in the Old World, begs to differ, and has asked to be taken to Mercier's island to judge with eyes unclouded. Unafraid of confronting challenging ideas, Hugo has accepted, and would like you to provide transport for the gentleman.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110731</GUID><Text>Capitalists love to blame their wretched policies on natural order, but our community exemplifies that humans are nothing but kind to each other when they are not being corrupted. A Social-Darwinist has expressed his desire to see for himself what our ideas translate into. We agreed — he needs only safe transport here.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110732</GUID><Text>That was the healthiest, most edifying debate I have had in a while! Dr. Sprucer has been convinced of the pure-hearted nature of men and women after meeting the most enlightened members of our community. Escort him safely back — he will make a good case for our true spirit to his heartless colleagues.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110733</GUID><Text>Hugo Mercier finds a kindred soul in Jean La Fortune, and has asked you to bring him one of his favourite essay collections as a gift.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110734</GUID><Text>I profoundly admire Mr. La Fortune. A true breaker of chains; founder of a nation free of oppressors! If anything, he should let go of that leadership he grasps so strongly, empower his people, and build up trust. He'd love a read of Krapotkin's "Reciprocal Support". Would you take it to him as a token of my esteem?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110735</GUID><Text>Dr. Mercier is radically opposed to all institutions. The police, as a weapon of the state, used to threaten individuals into an unnatural order, is perhaps the one he detests the most. He has challenged you to get rid of all your police stations.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110736</GUID><Text>People's voices must not be repressed under institutional coercion! Snap off the braces, and society will naturally straighten itself. Unless you fear the people's free will.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110737</GUID><Text>No trial is a fair trial under the corrupted laws of capitalism. Hugo has asked you to free some political prisoners from Eli Bleakworth's gaol, so they can be held accountable before his unbiased, enlightened people.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110738</GUID><Text>How can the people be blamed for rebelling against plutocrats? The lives taken by capitalism far exceed the ones those men were driven to take. Of course the corrupt justice system pronounced them guilty... Their fate must be decided by the people!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110913</GUID><Text>The state is far more than just an unnecessary institution — it is the most harmful fabrication of the privileged! We need to bring the government down by any means necessary, and burn their tools of intrusion!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110914</GUID><Text>The state is anarchy's ultimate enemy. As the main representative of the government around, Sir Archibald — or rather, his fleet — has become Dr. Mercier's main target for sabotage.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110917</GUID><Text>A couple of decrepit judges in powdered wigs should not hold power over the fate of men. Come, see how the whole community comes together to decide on a fitting punishment for this man's crimes, and witness what true justice looks like. Then document the event and showcase it to your people!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110918</GUID><Text>Dr. Mercier is proud of the justice system they've established, and has asked you to attend, listen to, photograph and publish an article about the trial they are holding.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110919</GUID><Text>Everything he stole belongs to the community! Dr. Hugo always warns about the ill-intentions of those who take things that naturally belong to humanity for their own selfish sake. He must not go unpunished!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110920</GUID><Text>Those goods belong to us all in the first place, so he is no thief. He simply needs to learn to reassess the extent of his needs. Persuasion goes further than punishment, Dr. Hugo always insists on that!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110921</GUID><Text>RESTORATIVE JUSTICE</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110922</GUID><Text>So long, coerced compliance of justice! A new anarchist approach is in town, and it promises to resolve conflicts by actually listening to the people affected and working towards an agreeable solution!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110923</GUID><Text>A merchant who'll pay a price that matches the effort needed to produce the goods, rather than the deflated value given to it by the so-called "free" market? I'd never fall for such a blatant attempt to infiltrate us. Follow her ship — bring me proof of her true intentions.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110924</GUID><Text>Dr. Mercier highly doubts that someone as complicit to capitalism as a merchant would willingly pay the prices the labour theory of value dictates. He's convinced she's up to no good, and has asked you to follow her so you can inform him of her true colours.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110925</GUID><Text>Utopian, naïve, childish, preposterous... Oh, how those stuck-ups at the medical school enjoyed mocking my ideals. But I have always been the better man. Yes, I will open up my doors to them, let them contemplate what they once laughed at. Deliver them these formal invitations.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110926</GUID><Text>Dr. Mercier has not forgotten how his colleagues at the medical school laughed at his anarchist ideas. But now that his dreams have become a reality, he has decided to extend a friendly invitation to them. Sounds like he can't wait to see the look on their faces...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110927</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald Blake, that phony old man... I bet the peacocks in his back garden are better fed than most of his queen's subjects. I despise those flamboyant creatures and everything they stand for... Yes, of course! If you want to prove something, kidnap one of his precious peacocks!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110928</GUID><Text>Oh! So this... this is the peacock, huh? Er-, yes... Yes! What to do next? Oh, I know — put it in your newspaper!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110929</GUID><Text>In a fit of genius, Hugo has suggested you steal one of Sir Archibald's peacocks. There seems to be a deeper meaning to the whole shenanigan that is not yet entirely clear to you...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110930</GUID><Text>PEACOCK DETENTION</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110931</GUID><Text>In an unexpected turn of events, our governor has decided to follow Dr. Hugo Mercier's hunch and steal one of Sir Archibald Blake's feathered pets. To what end, no one is yet entirely sure, but our editorial department has been informed that it is absolutely crucial!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111489</GUID><Text>Von Malching, loathsome baron of only the vilest form of liberalism, must be overthrown! He's drilled fear deep into his workers' brains, they need a push — nay, inspiration! — to rise against their oppressor!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111490</GUID><Text>Mercier thinks it's time for Von Malching's workers to realise that they have the power to put him in his place. He's tasked you with sneakily delivering some of his most brilliant instigators to Von Malching's shores, so they can spark a revolution.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111533</GUID><Text>What!? A riot!? No, no, no!! Stay where you are! I will not have this! Make them shut up, you incompetent milksops!!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111491</GUID><Text>Slavery is murder. Property is theft. Merchants prance the waters carrying the stolen fruits of the workers' labour, and claim to have the right to cut the hands of those who take back what's rightfully theirs. An enlightened soul would cut *their* hands...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111510</GUID><Text>The very concept of "property" is in itself an abuse — a usurpation. Simply put: theft. Hugo claims merchants should be the ones paying the price for their crimes.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111492</GUID><Text>A good friend of mine wrote that "the idea of God is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind." That church you have is indoctrinating your people into conformism. It is despicable. Many would celebrate you breaking those chains...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111511</GUID><Text>Religion poisons the minds of individuals into submission, such is the anarchists' conviction. Dr. Mercier hints that many people will be immensely happy if you could get rid of the archaic institution of the Church.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111493</GUID><Text>There isn't a single church left on this island, I made sure of that. But the preachers... still they creep in our streets, spreading their poisonous creeds. We cannot allow this — it is our moral duty to put an end to this age of obscurantism!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111512</GUID><Text>No matter how many churches Hugo razed to the ground, some pious preachers still remain on his island. As Hugo puts it, if you are virtuous, you will help him find them and stop them from pouring their venom.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111494</GUID><Text>Each individual must participate in the farming of the land: get grime under their nails; learn the gruelling labour that goes into providing for their community. But... not everyone yet equipped to farm the land properly, so the last harvest was not... efficient. It's a learning process, and I will not let them be discouraged by a small inconvenience! Send us some rations — no one needs to know.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111513</GUID><Text>Hugo established a job rotation so everyone in his community will, at some point, learn what it's like to work in the fields. Unfortunately, many of them are not quite there yet, and they are having some trouble keeping up with the basic demands of the population. Hugo has asked you to deliver some food — all the better if no one ever gets to know it was you who filled up their storerooms...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111495</GUID><Text>I would never dream of taking away people's right to revolt, but honestly, why can't these people understand that it takes time to build a new society? The issues they raise are nothing but a few bumps in the road to our utopia! You should talk some sense into them...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111514</GUID><Text>Sometimes, people can be truly short-sighted. Those who expect immediate results will naturally become agitated at the first sign of any inconvenience. Gently persuade the rioters on Dr. Mercier's island that a few bumps are to be expected on the road to a new society — and they should just learn to keep quiet...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111496</GUID><Text>People can be so slow witted! I have commissioned my favourite playwright to enact a play about the heroes of the commune, to hopefully stimulate our people's minds, and open their eyes as to the unlimited benefits of our system. A sugar coating can make the pill easier to swallow, and all that. Take a picture of the theatre goers to inform of the mandatory attendance. I will make sure they all look excited.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111515</GUID><Text>Hugo is fed up with having to explain the benefits of anarchy to his comrades, so he's staging a play at which attendance is mandatory — a play he hopes will spark their interest. Take a picture of the first batch of obligated theatre-goers to announce the event as if it were an exciting occasion.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111535</GUID><Text>A brand new script from the revolutionary playwright Umberto Brocht will be premiered in Hugo Mercier's theatres. "It is my brainiest, driest, most didactical script thus far", declared the author about the mandatory cultural event. Preview attendants looked like they tried their very best to enjoy every last bit of entertainment!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111534</GUID><Text>FOR THE COMMUNE</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111497</GUID><Text>The establishment propaganda machine will have you believe that anarchy is violent, chaotic, and unstable, but it is them who abuse violence to amass power and tear down those who defy them. I need to let my people know that they need not fear, for we have built a strong wall of defences to repel the weapons of the capital.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111516</GUID><Text>Dr. Mercier wants to spread the message that his people need not worry about being attacked by capitalist powers, which is why he would like you to take and print a photograph of his solid harbour defences.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111536</GUID><Text>PROTECTIVE CROWN</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111537</GUID><Text>Dr. Hugo Mercier has worked on reinforcing his shore's incisors with plenty of metal fillings that will stop cloying capitalists from striking the nerves of his city.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111498</GUID><Text>War reminds men of the things that truly matter. It'd be hard even for these simpletons to complain about the petty details with an enemy at our doorstep. They leave me no choice but to fabricate one...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111521</GUID><Text>Hugo Mercier is having trouble keeping his people in line. He hopes that focusing their energy on a war against a common enemy will distract them from the petty details that have been raising their scepticism, but he needs your help in putting together his charade.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111538</GUID><Text>ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111539</GUID><Text>Landslide victory of Dr. Hugo Mercier casts away the fiendish enemies that wish to incarcerate his people within vicious liberalism. Trust towards their selfless leader reaches historical heights, as their profound sense of community strengthens in the face of adversity.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111499</GUID><Text>As a leader, I am no ruler — I am a vessel. A vessel for the voice of every individual in this community. I need to hear their true voices, what their minds and hearts are claiming for. They would discuss it more openly with a neutral party. A party like you.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111522</GUID><Text>Dr. Hugo Mercier needs to hear the voice of his people in order to be a good leader for them, but he believes they will speak their minds more candidly to you.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111540</GUID><Text>POPULAR UNISON</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111541</GUID><Text>A survey conducted on Dr. Hugo Mercier's island reveals that 100% of its population agrees with every decision their beloved leader makes.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111552</GUID><Text>... and we're almost out of medicam-... Oh! Hello, comrade! Our thoughts on Dr. Hugo? Well, things couldn't be going better! Yes, everything's fine — everything's absolutely perfect. Now, if you'll excuse me...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111553</GUID><Text>... what are we going to do when the cold comes b-...? Shh! Good day, comrade! Dr. Hugo? Yes, yes, he's the greatest leader we could ask for! We have nothing — absolutely nothing — bad to say about him. Adieu.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111554</GUID><Text>... there's only so much left after my children have finished eat- W-wow, you startled me! What was I saying? Oh, never mind... We love Dr. Hugo, yes we do! And my children do too! Yes, yes, very much so! Well, good day.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111500</GUID><Text>Do not underestimate the dirty tricks the establishment is willing to use to undermine regimes such as ours. They have infiltrated our community, and now they are conspiring to take me down. Find them — I believe they'll be pretending to enjoy culture...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111523</GUID><Text>Dr. Mercier is certain that there's a group of establishment infiltrators conspiring to overthrow him. He has tasked you with finding them. They might be around one of the few places on Mercier's island that has something to do with entertainment.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111555</GUID><Text>We aren't conspirators, I swear! My children were hungry — I had to take a bit more than usual! Please, please, don't take us to Dr. Hugo! We can take the next ferry out of here, and you can just pretend you never saw us.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111501</GUID><Text>Oh, hello! Apparently some people from our community have arrived at your docks... by mistake. They were meaning to go, er... somewhere else. As they have no means of return, I must ask that you deliver them to us — back to their friends and families, of course.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111524</GUID><Text>A group of people from Mercier's island have appeared at your docks. Never mind them saying that they mean to stay with you — they are a bit disoriented from the swaying of the ship, and need your help to get back home.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111502</GUID><Text>Decayed traitors, willing to lick the boots of those who stomp on us in exchange for shiny, meaningless trinkets! Wreck them! Make an example out of them!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111525</GUID><Text>A gang of traitors have fled Mercier's island. He has asked you to sink their ship, and help him make an example out of them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111556</GUID><Text>Please, we have children with us! All we wanted was to live in peace. Have pity, please! I will work for you!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111504</GUID><Text>No sane person can see that many flaws in our perfect utopia. One of my mentors at the Academy of Medicine, Dr. Cotton, discovered mental illness to be but a reflection of untreated infections in the body. My people deserve to be cured. I will require her expertise — and some new tools...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111527</GUID><Text>What greater indication of mental illness is there than the inability to recognise the many advantages of anarchy? Dr. Mercier needs some new tools — and the knowledge of his former mentor, Dr. Harriet Cotton — to treat those who dissent against his policies.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111557</GUID><Text>It's been a long time, Dr. Cotton. Please, make yourself at home. Yes, this is our first patient. He has already been numbed. So, which molar should I pull out...?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111505</GUID><Text>If those separatists have time to dwell on harmful thoughts, it is because they're not working hard enough! Disorders of the mind vanish with every blister you burst for the well-being of your community. Gather my patients, I will ease their minds!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111528</GUID><Text>More and more people are finding reasons to complain about Dr. Mercier's leadership. He, of course, considers this to be a symptom of their foggy minds. Luckily, he's devised a way to clear them: excruciatingly tough labour.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111506</GUID><Text>Remember, remember... how their so-called justice has failed and abused us all. A true envoy of justice would blow up the very foundations of that crooked system. And from the smouldering remains, genuine freedom would arise....</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111529</GUID><Text>In an even more eloquent manner than usual, Dr. Hugo Mercier has suggested you install a large volume of gunpowder around the landmark of Her Majesty's justice system: Wormways Prison.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111558</GUID><Text>Gunpowder, treason and plot... Such are the charges "Her Majesty" holds against me. Yet I am but a vessel that carries the indignant fire of a nation, on my way to ignite the blast that will demolish their fabricated order.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111560</GUID><Text>In an almost overly dramatic move, Dr. Hugo has set a whole ship on fire as a metaphor for his bombastic leadership. It now falls to you to be its chaperone, on its way to blow Wormways to pieces.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111559</GUID><Text>I see no reason why this gunpowder treason should ever be forgot! May this historical moment provide a blueprint for generations to follow!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111561</GUID><Text>After the theatrical detonation at Wormways Prison, many a prisoner managed to escape from their cells and jump into the water. You can't just leave them to drown!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111508</GUID><Text>Leon and I have stood together ever since we first picketed at the Academy... Could it be him? He contradicts my every decision, second guesses every word I say... It wouldn't be past that wretched Queen to hold my trust in my comrades against me...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111531</GUID><Text>Dr. Hugo Mercier feels it — the prying gaze of his old comrade Leon upon his every move, waiting for the perfect moment to sell him out to the Queen... In order to either confirm or dispel Mercier's doubts, you must follow the man and see what business he is truly up to.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111574</GUID><Text>A fair trade again, Mr. Leon. But I must admit, I am surprised at your colleague, Dr. Mercier. I had imagined an advocate for chaos would be a less reliable supplier. Do give him my compliments.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111575</GUID><Text>A simple trade? He must have noticed you and concealed any sign of his betrayal... There must be something in his books that proves he is double-crossing our people! We must dig deeper!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111577</GUID><Text>Far from being convinced of Leon's innocence, Dr. Mercier has urged you to go through his old colleague's personal records, both at his workplace and his home, to see if you can find any evidence that would prove him guilty of treason.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111580</GUID><Text>My apologies... We've looked everywhere, and there is nothing at all that would lead anyone to believe that Leon is anything but a devoted anarchist and a competent representative of the people...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111581</GUID><Text>What exactly are you looking for? Is my Leon in trouble...? But he's the most loyal man in the world! He talks with such passion about how exciting it is to be part of this revolution, hand in hand with his old friend Hugo...!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111583</GUID><Text>Lies! Of course he made sure to erase every trace of his treachery! Or are you on his side too!? No? Then prove it! Sneak this into his ship's hold! I will expose the viper at any cost, and save my people from his poison!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111584</GUID><Text>Not yet satisfied with the results of your investigation, Dr. Mercier wants you to make sure that there is evidence to incriminate his old friend Leon of conspiring against his regime. Even if you have to create it yourself.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111588</GUID><Text>People from every corner of the world have joined our community since we embarked on this endeavour, but we haven't received any newcomers for months now... I have reason to believe the crown are blockading us. Someone must look into this...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111589</GUID><Text>The number of people joining Dr. Mercier's utopia has suddenly halted, and he suspects the Queen may be to blame. He needs you to conduct some investigations into this matter.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111590</GUID><Text>Help! Please! We were attacked on our way to Dr. Hugo's utopia! Ohh, we worked so hard to build those ships, and now... all of them, burnt to ashes! The attackers, they bore the Crown's sigil! Don't leave us here, I beg you!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111591</GUID><Text>Flamethrowers! So that's what that queen has been up to! Well, I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree after all. We will have to be very wary of them...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111592</GUID><Text>Oh, hello! I merely intended to alert you about Dr. Mercier. He most definitely has a gift with words, but there may be less... consequential content to them than one might imagine. I believe your heart is in the right place, but please... Bear this in mind in future.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111593</GUID><Text>We abhor violence, but this abuse from the Crown must be repaid in kind! So many honest lives lost at sea, and their only crime was to believe a better world was possible! Enough! What goes around comes around.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111594</GUID><Text>Unable to bear the Queen's pressure any longer, Dr. Mercier has asked you to help him warn her that any harm she does to his people will be returned.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111595</GUID><Text>Whyever would you do that!? Attacks...? Well, I can assure you Her Majesty knows absolutely nothing about that! He is manipulating you like he manipulated all those people! Do not fall for it, I sincerely beg of you. Stay loyal to your queen!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111596</GUID><Text>You have earned our trust. My trust. Being discreet as you always are, you will have no problem delivering this man to the royal residence unseen. Believe me, it is of the utmost importance.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111597</GUID><Text>Dr. Mercier requires you to sneak past Sir Archibald's patrols, and make sure a very enigmatic masked man arrives at High Clarence Hall docks unseen. Where have you seen that mask before...?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111602</GUID><Text>The fuse is burning, we must brace for the grand finale! As the royal fleet heads for us, you must decide: are you willing to fight for enlightenment and equality, or will you support centuries of oppression and obscurantism?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111603</GUID><Text>After months of tensions between Mercier and the Crown, the conflict is about to reach an armed resolution. You must now choose which side you are on: anarchy or monarchy.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111604</GUID><Text>A truly individual thinker! I am so proud of you, comrade! Here — our scientists have developed these explosives. Regrettably, we will very soon be needing them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111605</GUID><Text>Thank you for staying a sane constant throughout this most regrettable affair... Her Majesty didn't want things to come to this, but alas, it seems to be the only way forward now...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111606</GUID><Text>The flame has risen, our job is done. Time to report back.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111607</GUID><Text>You have spotted a mysterious ship observing the battle from afar. Follow them, and find out what their role was in the events that just unfolded.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111608</GUID><Text>Everything went exactly as planned. Now both Mercier and the Queen are weak enough for us to take control. Igne Natura Renovatur! Wait, who are you...? Intruders! They mustn't escape!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111609</GUID><Text>It can't be... Were the Pyrphorians manipulating us all from the start? Oh dear... Dr. Mercier really did believe it was us who attacked his people. I must speak to him at once — as much as we disagree, neither of us meant these hostilities.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111610</GUID><Text>The... the Pyrphorians...? But... No, it was the Queen...! She hates our utopia — she is a despot and a schemer! Those people must have been under her command all along!

All we want is an honest life; please, let us live here!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111887</GUID><Text>When you see the happy smiling faces among Dr. Mercier's commune, you know their struggles are over. Their pain is over. Why not show your own people what they're missing?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111901</GUID><Text>Your people are envious of life in Dr. Mercier's commune. They are insisting you publish an image of one of his islands in your newspaper — even if it tarnishes your own reputation in the process.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111915</GUID><Text>THE BLESSINGS OF ANARCHY</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111916</GUID><Text>An unprecedented photographic report illustrates the idyllic life of people on Dr. Hugo Mercier's island, where all individuals are equal, and not one is better clothed or fed than their neighbour.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111888</GUID><Text>The folk who came over from Dr. Mercier's island have opened our eyes! If we have the skill to fashion products from steel, then it is us who is entitled to that product, not you!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111902</GUID><Text>Dr. Mercier's ideas are spreading among your residents, and they're beginning to suspect it is only you who benefits from all they produce. They demand a large quantity of the steel beams and weapons they've sweated over be awarded to them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111889</GUID><Text>Oi, boss, ever heard of the labour theory of value? It's our sweat and blisters that should give gubbins their pricetag! Yet our wages are risible compared to what those soft-handed artisans get. Redress the balance, before we break it!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111903</GUID><Text>The workers have become acquainted with some aspects of anarchist theory, and they now demand to be compensated for all the value their labour has lost on the capitalist free market.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111890</GUID><Text>Bread is but the basics of a meal! Are you a stuck up bourgeois that just tells the common people to go "eat brioche"? Hand out the loaves, now!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111904</GUID><Text>Your workers will not settle for the crumbs! If you want to keep your empire from crumbling from within, you'd better keep their bellies full.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111891</GUID><Text>We workers know what we're doing! Let us manage our own! Give us a space to unite and decide collectively, like on Dr. Hugo's island!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111905</GUID><Text>Your workers are claiming their right to control and manage the means of production. A trade union would be the perfect space for them to come together and debate.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111892</GUID><Text>You intoxicate us with the lies of priests to keep us compliant in the face of oppression! We don't want any more churches — give us temples of democracy instead!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111906</GUID><Text>Your workers are fed up with having their minds numbed by religion. They demand you take down a church and replace it with a town hall — or else...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111893</GUID><Text>As long as we depend on goods from other nations, we are hostages to the free market! You'd better make sure we're not buying more than we're selling!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111907</GUID><Text>It's important for your workers that you make sure your nation is self-sufficient, and doesn't rely on goods from other nations. They will not be satisfied until your trade balance is positive.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111894</GUID><Text>If we must play along with the laws of capitalism, then we'll play them at their own game! If we over-supply, prices will have to drop. Maybe to the point where anyone can just help themselves to whatever they need!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111908</GUID><Text>Overproducing, Mercier argues, is actually a good thing for the people, since the prices drop so much it becomes unnecessary to track who helps themselves to what. That is what your workers want for your island too.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111895</GUID><Text>Why build so many police stations? Are you scared of the voice of the people? We will not tolerate this authoritarian repression! Try and address our problems instead!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111909</GUID><Text>When police are everywhere, justice is nowhere. So your workers have come to believe after learning more about anarchy. They have destroyed all your police stations, and their violence will resume if you can't maintain the peace without them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111896</GUID><Text>Your laws protect the privileged! It's time you legislate for the people, or we'll destroy the entire system!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111910</GUID><Text>Fed up with an unjust system, your people demand you institute laws that protect the common classes.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111897</GUID><Text>Our new anarchist peers have opened our eyes to the evils of society! The boys made this poster at the union to spread the word. I reckon you'll have no issue in putting it up on our town hall, right?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111911</GUID><Text>Your workers are thrilled by everything they've learnt about anarchy. In fact, so taken are they that they've stayed up all night creating a poster to paste on your town hall.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111898</GUID><Text>You embody the establishment! We will join Dr. Hugo's commune and become free, equal individuals! You want to prove you're a decent human being? Then don't be a sore loser, and shelter our path!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111912</GUID><Text>There is no stopping these workers from leaving your island to join Dr. Mercier's people, but if you still want to be decent towards them, you can make sure they at least have safe passage to his island.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111899</GUID><Text>No wonder we're turning against capitalism when we lead such pathetic lives! If we were twice as happy, we wouldn't be looking for a way out!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111913</GUID><Text>The only reason your workers are starting to find anarchy attractive is because they are miserable. Well, maybe miserable is putting a bit strongly, but they could certainly be happier!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111900</GUID><Text>Dr. Hugo is the brightest mind of the century! If he doesn't respect you, why should we!?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111914</GUID><Text>You are at odds with Dr. Hugo Mercier, which means your workers — who look up to the anarchist leader — are at odds with you. Perhaps winning the heart of the doctor will earn you the love of your people.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111944</GUID><Text>As workers, labour is our greatest power! The lads that came over from Mercier's say they feel mighty good after a long day of hard work. Come on, let's add some more fuel!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111945</GUID><Text>Dr. Hugo's anarchist theory states that workers achieve their greatest value when their produce remains within their community. You're not sure if your workers understand the full picture, but they do want to work harder, so who are you to argue with them?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111962</GUID><Text>With so much talk about the evils of religion, priests are starting to be persecuted! Even if you can sympathise, no soul deserves to be threatened because of their beliefs. Protect them!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111963</GUID><Text>The anarchist mistrust of the clergy has spread to your population. It appears some of your workers are harassing priests! A concerned citizen has asked you to find them and defend them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111964</GUID><Text>Oh no... Oh, there you are! I just heard something very — deeply! — vexing.  It appears the anarchists are planning an attack! You must stop the man with the torch! Please, I beg of you!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111972</GUID><Text>A panicked artisan came looking for your help. He overheard a group of anarchists discussing an impending attack on your city. Find the man bearing the torch before it's too late!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111965</GUID><Text>Inspector Langdon says he's too busy chasing away anarchist troublemakers to look into the disappearance of my hens! Can't you give them a hand...?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111973</GUID><Text>The police have been overwhelmed lately, as they try to uncover the anarchist infiltrators, but your people have other problems they need their help with! Help them unearth the anarchist gangs to free up some space on their plate.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111966</GUID><Text>The anarchists are setting fire to every piece of writing that doesn't align with their convictions! Even if I can see where their grievances are coming from, this is the greatest crime I can possibly fathom! Please, stop this intellectual genocide!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111974</GUID><Text>Aghast, an engineer has alerted you to some anarchists who are going around burning books. It doesn't matter whether their ideas are valid or not — in her eyes, no book must ever be burnt.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111967</GUID><Text>Darn those lousy, wretched anarchists! You! You're lucky my family were lounging at the Dawson's summer resort when they torched our household! Restore it! Immediately!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111975</GUID><Text>As much as Dr. Mercier likes to brag that anarchy is peaceful, his followers on your island seem to have a different perspective. They've wrecked an investor's residence, and he's now demanding that you build him a new one, at once.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111968</GUID><Text>No! My factory! My life's work, ruined! Why would anarchists confuse my modest craftsmanship with their dragon, capitalism? Please, would you restore the dreams they robbed me of?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111976</GUID><Text>The anarchist attacks are not only targeting wealthy investors, but humble artisans too. With his business reduced to ashes, this poor man has lost his livelihood. Help him restore it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111969</GUID><Text>You saved our lives! We are eternally grateful! Please, if there's anything we can do — any way at all that we could be of use to you — allow me to repay your kindness with my expertise!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111977</GUID><Text>Among the people who arrived from Dr. Mercier's island, some have pledged to work for you as a way of repaying you for your hospitality.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111970</GUID><Text>Make no mistake — I might look like a worker, but I'm a trained engineer. I joined Mercier on the promise of a better world, but it turned out to be a fallacy... My designs will serve a better purpose here.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111978</GUID><Text>There was a brilliant engineer amongst the last batch of anarchist defectors you allowed into your city. He is more than happy to share his creations with you.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111971</GUID><Text>I was so fed up with Mercier screaming lies at our faces with this loudspeaker, I just had to take it away from him! Ugh, I can't even stand the sight of this wretched thing. Take it off me, please!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111979</GUID><Text>This anarchist defector was so done with listening to Dr. Mercier through his loudspeaker that he snatched it away the second he had the chance. He is now offering it to you.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>112159</GUID><Text>Anarchy Quest</Text></Text><Text><GUID>112198</GUID><Text>Dr. Mercier used to be a respectable dental practitioner before he became the leader of an anarchist regime. You either see eye to eye with him, or you are an ally of his oppressors, there is no middle ground... But if he agrees to trade with us, we may get access to some very unique merchandise on his trading post.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110939</GUID><Text>Workers are enthused by the new system of written labour notes to reward their efforts.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110940</GUID><Text>A new and better printing machine helps distribute labour notes to workers at no maintenance cost!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>110941</GUID><Text>The labour notes are now so beautifully typeset and presented, they really look like they're worth something!

Such a disproportionate escort suggests that our informants were correct: they must be transporting the Sceptre of Capon that our King is seeking.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113834</GUID><Text>La Corona’s fleet is vast in terms of size and number, but ours is staffed with seamen both seasoned and loyal.

I admit, taking the talisman would greatly damage La Corona's national spirit — but what of our own, when a thousand or more sailors are sent to their deaths for a trinket! No, we must have no other thought than employing the very best tactics to win the day.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113835</GUID><Text>Since the King will no longer leave the safety of his fortress atop the cliffs, we may be able to blame the fog for not complying with his signals.&lt;br/&gt;There were a few other incidents today. At 3pm we intercepted two enemy gunboats, and ran them aground between two small islands to the Southeast, with cliffs like two guard dogs facing one another.&lt;br/&gt;At 4:30pm we discovered a frigate bearing the emblem of La Corona, smuggling crates out of a pirate cove in the spiral-shaped cluster of islands that lie due east.&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, we had a skirmish with a ship-of-the-line near an old watchtower, between the three large islands due west. She sank with all her cargo.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113836</GUID><Text>Tuesday, 15 October 1805</Text></Text><Text><GUID>112544</GUID><Text>La Corona opened fire this morning. We engaged in battle at 10am, south east of the region — a conflict which lasted until seven in the evening.&lt;br/&gt;We lost many good men today — the sly young Admiral Silva having deployed mines to protect the enemy convoy. It was the King's command that we attack in a single line, parallel to the enemy formation. Fortunately, I was able to persuade the fleet to ignore this instruction, and instead arrange themselves into two perpendicular columns to cut through the enemy line — and as a corollary, avoid the mines. Our lead ships were blown apart, but it left a path clear for the rest of us. The enemy fleet, being snipped into thirds, were vulnerable to broadsides. We proceeded to drive them toward their own mines, and though in the mayhem there were casualties on both sides, we knew victory for the Empire had been won.&lt;br/&gt;We thank those brave sailors who lost their lives today that we ourselves survived, and shall never forget their sacrifice. The price would have been far greater had we sworn blind obedience to the King's strategy.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113837</GUID><Text>It will doubtless anger him to hear his orders were defied, but I stand by my decision. It may even please him to hear I have been wounded for my arrogance. It's likely my dress and decorations made me a conspicuous target, and I took a shot of musket to my side.&lt;br/&gt;My arm still has full function — and my head is not half as foggy as the doctor thinks it to be — so I will continue my command until our operation here has concluded. La Corona may have suffered a defeat of magnitude today, but their flagship — the gargantuan Santíssima Vitória — managed to escape unscathed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113838</GUID><Text>Wednesday, 16 October 1805</Text></Text><Text><GUID>112545</GUID><Text>The King is, indeed, mad. He appears to care nothing for our victory, and was upset in the extreme to learn that we hadn't yet begun pursuit of the Santíssima Vitória, for he is adamant that the Sceptre of Capon is on board.&lt;br/&gt; Having received word that the flagship was heading northeast, His Majesty ordered Captain Richardson — of the HMS Ajax — to go after her. Under no circumstances will he permit us to accompany them. I have tried to inform the King that the Ajax is ill-equipped for the duel, but my injury leaves me weak, and I have had to retire to my quarters. Santíssima Vitória may be the largest man-of-war ever built. Richardson knows he leads his men to their deaths, but he has always been a man unwavering in his sense of duty.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113839</GUID><Text>Thursday, 24th October, 1805</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113840</GUID><Text>It is unseasonably, morbidly hot. A rowboat was found this morning, beached on the headland — brought in on the current, presumably, for its occupants are three days dead of thirst. In a clenched hand, one held a letter from Richardson —  these men were sent to find help, the crew of the Ajax surviving a clash with the Santíssima Vitória only by swimming to an island south east of the headland.&lt;br/&gt;We immediately dispatched a rescue boat, but it was too late: Richardson and his crew have met the same fate. We found no trace of the Santíssima Vitória, either. His Majesty's reaction is predictable. These lives were taken by his hands, yet he weeps only for the sceptre.&lt;br/&gt;My wounds fester, and my fever worsens. The doctor says I must put down my pen.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113842</GUID><Text>In the best interest of both our nations, I, Vasco Oliveira Silva, servant of His Majesty King João of A Coroa, agree to surrender the piece of the Sceptre of Capon currently in my custody, namely the pommel of the sceptre, in the event of my failing to discover the final piece of the sceptre (the eagle) first — so long as the counterparty agrees to do the same in the opposite event.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113843</GUID><Text>Vasco Oliveira Silva</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113844</GUID><Text>H</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113845</GUID><Text>K</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113846</GUID><Text>HK</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113847</GUID><Text>F</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113848</GUID><Text>Courses</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113849</GUID><Text>Winds</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113850</GUID><Text>Remarks on Wednesday, 16th October, 1805</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113851</GUID><Text>SSW</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113852</GUID><Text>West</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113853</GUID><Text>NbE</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113854</GUID><Text>SbE</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113855</GUID><Text>ESE</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113856</GUID><Text>SbE</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113857</GUID><Text>NW</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113858</GUID><Text>North</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113859</GUID><Text>SSE</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113860</GUID><Text>East</Text></Text><Text><GUID>113861</GUID><Text>2 AM: Our patrol was uneventful.

Not the actions of the much-trumpeted Admiral Nadasky.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111689</GUID><Text>We were the victors here at Trelawney, yet all the spoils remain in the lap of Poseidon.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111688</GUID><Text>He may have been on the winning side, but father always said Admiral Nadasky's carelessness had meant the Sceptre being lost to the waves.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111687</GUID><Text>It was father's greatest regret that he was never able to hold the sceptre. I'm sure that insecurity about his position made him cling to power all the more perfervidly.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111686</GUID><Text>The Sceptre of Capon has long granted its bearers indisputable authority. But it sank to the depths, along with La Corona's fleet.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111685</GUID><Text>We share a bloodline, you know. I have as much right to the Sceptre as King João.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111684</GUID><Text>As this could easily be my last unofficial visit anywhere, I intend to enjoy my freedom.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111683</GUID><Text>I had rather a stuffy childhood.

Mother let me out in the garden on sunny days.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111681</GUID><Text>Dear old Archie has been like a father to me, but had I told him I was coming here, he'd have sent for far too many flowers and servants.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111680</GUID><Text>Finding the sunken Sceptre of Capon — the trophy we never claimed for that victory — will remind us of our past glories and restore the people's faith in their monarch.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111699</GUID><Text>It's obvious why they're here. It's the same reason we're here; for the emblematic power that sceptre will grant to whoever owns it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111700</GUID><Text>One imagined if one was secretive enough, La Corona might not discover one's intentions — yet of course, here they are at the double.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>112208</GUID><Text>I saw it from the deck: an impish little man dredging up bits and pieces. He may be exactly what we require…</Text></Text><Text><GUID>112209</GUID><Text>If we are to find anything in this graveyard, we might as well commission the vulture.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>112210</GUID><Text>I will happily shake those greasy paws if it means I get my sceptre.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>112246</GUID><Text>But we can't afford a war with La Corona — feeble though they may be — so I'm afraid you'll have to rely on wits to beat this Oliveira to it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>112249</GUID><Text>Could this be…? This is the journal of my father's strategist, Nadasky!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>112275</GUID><Text>Help me build it, and find the sceptre, and I shall designate you Warden of Trelawney, my official representative in these waters.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>112279</GUID><Text>I see we are not the first to pay Old Nate for these coordinates...

Upon my return to the capital, I shall have a great big pillar built in his honour.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111706</GUID><Text>The facts here are plain. Had they followed only father's orders, La Corona would have won.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111705</GUID><Text>The King, my father, draws further away from his daughter with each new revelation in Nadasky's log.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111704</GUID><Text>This log is proof Nadasky may at least have had good intentions in his defiance of father's orders.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111703</GUID><Text>This entry shows that they persisted in deviating from father's instructions…</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111702</GUID><Text>Another part of Admiral Nadasky's logbook… Fascinating reading…</Text></Text><Text><GUID>111719</GUID><Text>One is no dunce-hatted imbecile, but I rather think we'll need a class swot or two to decipher this; a university with a budding college of palaeographers to decipher Nadasky's shameful handwriting. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>111720</GUID><Text>Oh, it's all much clearer now! Do thank your expert bods at the University for all their brio.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>112213</GUID><Text>So you're playing best of three?

We waited the entire summer for the thaw, but the weather gods were against us: they're still stuck fast in the ice. I am certain we can still &lt;b&gt;find the NW passage by foot&lt;/b&gt;, walking inland. We've filled two lifeboats with essential supplies, and will pull them over the snow like sleds. When next we find water, it will be a passage to the east! Then the lifeboats can row us to a safe haven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;May 4th, 1848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The men tire. Dragging two lifeboats was perhaps ambitious, so they've been stopping to rest at regular intervals.&lt;br/&gt;I have ordered that all remaining supplies be trusted to one of the lifeboats from now on, giving us double the pulling power.&lt;br/&gt;Despite setbacks, morale is good, and &lt;b&gt;we've lost no men &lt;/b&gt; since winter on Baffling Island.&lt;/i&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>114597</GUID><Text>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;May 11th, 1848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are at a crossroads. To determine the best way forward, I sent a team led by Cdr. H. Sturgeon through the &lt;b&gt;canyon&lt;/b&gt; to the north. A second team led by Lt Cdr. R. Des Yeux went over the &lt;b&gt;snow dunes&lt;/b&gt; to the west. The last team, led by Lt Cdr. E. Couch, went towards deep &lt;b&gt;chasms&lt;/b&gt; in the east.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;May 14th, 1848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;No team has yet returned.&lt;/b&gt; Camp supplies are becoming rather scarce, and there's little out here to hunt. I think we'd even gobble up those seals the Inuit offered us now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;May 16th, 1848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Only two of the three teams have returned.&lt;/b&gt; I fear the worst has befallen Edgar Couch's men — a risk we all took the day we volunteered. It's hard out here; cruel. The rest of us are to move without delay; their sacrifice will not be wasted if we make it.&lt;br/&gt;Cdr. Sturgeon reports that &lt;b&gt;his canyon tapered to a dead end&lt;/b&gt;. Des Yeux, God thank him, reports something more promising. &lt;b&gt;We will take the path he took.&lt;/b&gt; The ground looks too weak for the boat, but I'm sure we'll think of something. We always do.&lt;/i&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>114598</GUID><Text>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;June 21st, 1848&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the warnings of these Inuit had worth. &lt;b&gt;The ice desert has been treacherous&lt;/b&gt;, and we have lost both men and equipment. I see darkness in the eyes of the living, now that their companions lie buried. If you knew that we are also at the end of our supplies, you might understand their anger. &lt;br/&gt;But they are loyal men, and know they cannot hope to survive alone. They will only challenge me if I admit defeat, and that I refuse. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sheer mountain lies ahead.&lt;/b&gt; I have had to stifle my shock at its sudden appearance, and at the perilous climb we must now undertake, for morale among the men is already low. I would not appear in my right mind as their leader if I asked them to turn and face the horrors of the desert we had all thought behind us. No. &lt;b&gt;We climb.&lt;/b&gt; And meeting us at the summit, I believe, will be a view upon the shimmering water of a Northwest Passage that shall sate the hunger. &lt;/i&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>114599</GUID><Text>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;June 30th, 1848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost my best man, Cdr. Sturgeon, in the mountains. Poor man was too anxious to prove me right. Some made it, but all hungry and desperate. You need shovel-loads to fuel your belly up here, and we have no food at all.

Cdr. Remi Des Yeux&lt;/b&gt;, with the completion of his log, as he no longer has the strength to put pen to paper. Still, there likely won't be many more entries left for me to write. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are no longer killed by bears, but &lt;b&gt;have been lost days and weeks in high valleys&lt;/b&gt; that all look the same, having lost our compass. We are now only six: Captain John Faithful; Sargent, the first mate; Little, an engineer; Hodgson, an assistant surgeon; Irving, a ship's boy; and myself. The boy lives because he is a good lad, and none of us could suffer to eat of him. The bear meat never was going to last, you see. Sir John did have us swear never to speak of that shame, but who does he think we will tell?&lt;/i&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>115189</GUID><Text>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;August 7th, 1848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sir John speaks again. He says the &lt;b&gt;silhouette of a great wolf&lt;/b&gt; came to him in his sleep, and that he wishes to meet us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our pack is down to three. Sir John, the boy Irving, and me, Remi Des Yeux. We shall remember Sargent, Little and Hodgson. We shall remember the others who tripped and fell, who froze, who fell ill, who starved, who drowned, who were maimed by bears, who slipped on high, or fell through the cracks. And we shall remember those who, when we ran out of food, drew the short straw... in vain! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a passage exists, we have not found it.&lt;/b&gt; But though he is mad, I will accompany Sir John to the end. The ferocious ship's boy, Irving, is our guardian spirit — the same who, with superhuman strength, was able to fend off grown men in the snow who were after his legs for supper.&lt;/i&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>116691</GUID><Text>Qumaq suggests you follow the tracks near the boats.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>116685</GUID><Text>Qumaq wonders which way they went next.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>116686</GUID><Text>Qumaq says the expedition had to drop their supplies.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>116687</GUID><Text>Qumaq says there may be bears about.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>116688</GUID><Text>Qumaq holds little hope for Sir John and his crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>116689</GUID><Text>Qumaq doubts whether Sir John's crew could have made it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>116803</GUID><Text>Lady Jane is delighted to hand you the reward she promised.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>116926</GUID><Text>Lady Faithful has taken a step back: it is now up to you and Qumaq to scout the vast northern ice cap from above in search of the lost expedition.

She would never think of harming the crew, of course... But when they're all ashore...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16702</GUID><Text>One of Bente's expeditions didn't make it back to port safely. The crew are OK, but the precious hummingbirds they were carrying are still lost amongst the wreckage.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16703</GUID><Text>A visitor's ship has been in a terrible accident, and the passengers need to be saved! Bente has asked for your help.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16704</GUID><Text>Bente was awaiting the arrival of some precious relics from one of her expeditions, but it seems the sailors believed they were cursed, so they've thrown them overboard. She's asked you to recover the artefacts for her.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16705</GUID><Text>Bente wants to increase environmental awareness. She's positive that seeing you both cleaning the oceans together will, one day, make people understand.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16707</GUID><Text>Bente is confident that nothing bad will happen to her on her expeditions, but her advisors still worry it might be dangerous to go alone. She'd like you to escort her until her advisors start to relax.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16708</GUID><Text>Bente's cousin Alva paid her a visit, but decided to leave earlier than planned after meeting the household pets. Bente has asked if you would escort her cousin home.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18303</GUID><Text>Bente would like you to take pictures of her artefacts, which she can then frame and hang from the walls.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18333</GUID><Text>Bente would like you to build a zoo, to help the people of your city reconnect with nature.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18334</GUID><Text>Bente has so many artefacts, she can't have them all on display. She hopes you'll open a museum soon, so she can donate them to your collection.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18340</GUID><Text>Bente wants your help in bringing some wild animals on her island into the safety of her zoo for the winter.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18341</GUID><Text>Bente would like you to collect some exotic animals she has first dibs on from Madame Kahina.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18353</GUID><Text>Bente would like to gift you an extremely beautiful and loyal animal as a pet.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18354</GUID><Text>Bente has just returned from an eventful expedition - and since you're a close friend, she brought back a souvenir for you.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18355</GUID><Text>Bente would like to help you stave off any potential money problems with a small charitable donation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18377</GUID><Text>Somewhat surprisingly, Bente wants you to smuggle some eastern treasures out of High Clarence Hall and return them to their rightful dynastic owners via Princess Qing.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18378</GUID><Text>George sent Bente some animals that were mistreated, but it seems like something has happened to them en route.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18386</GUID><Text>Bente's advisors think it's time for her to marry. They have a Mr. Bingle lined up, whom she's at least willing to meet. Sir Archibald would be the obvious person to bring them together at a garden party.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18387</GUID><Text>Bente needs a dress to wear to attend a garden party and meet her potential husband, Mr Bingle. Apparently, Madame Kahina has a nice selection for formal occasions.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18388</GUID><Text>It is with regret that Bente agrees, at the request of Sir Archibald and Mr. Bingle, to sever ties with Alonso Graves, with whom she is good friends. She asks if you could deliver him a letter and a parting gift.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18389</GUID><Text>Having received Bente's letter severing ties with him, Alonso would like to have a little tête-à-tête with Mr. Bingle. He asks you to arrange for them to meet.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18390</GUID><Text>In one final twist, Alonso would like you to photograph Mr. Bingle with the pigs in his pigsty. The image may encourage Bente to rethink any potential engagement, or indeed, any further association of any sort.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18399</GUID><Text>Bente thinks the young children the noble Beryl O'Mara rescued from the street deserve a little bit of pampering at the palace, and wants you to ask Sir Archibald if that would be OK.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18400</GUID><Text>Bente's proposal that Beryl's street children stay at High Clarence Hall for a short time has met with the royal seal of approval. It's up to you to ferry them there safely.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18401</GUID><Text>Bente is rather embarrassed to have to write a letter to Sir Archibald apologising for the behaviour of Beryl's street children at the palace. She wants you to deliver it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18406</GUID><Text>§--18406--§</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18413</GUID><Text>§--18413--§</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18417</GUID><Text>Bente is worried she hasn't heard from her New World expedition in weeks. She wants you to find them, and revive the expedition with vital supplies. Perhaps you can also figure out what happened...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18418</GUID><Text>Having been found, Bente's expedition captain reaches out to you. Everyone aboard seems to be too stunned to remember what happened to them, and how they ended up being wrecked. Perhaps there are clues nearby...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18419</GUID><Text>Finally realising the sequence of events, the captain reluctantly agrees to lead you to the flotsam, so you can recover what he believes to be a cursed artefact.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18420</GUID><Text>Recovering the artefact does indeed seem to have cursed your ship, and you never found those missing crewmen... But Bente won't believe any of that, so you'd better bring her the mummy.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18421</GUID><Text>The mummy you gave Bente to put in her museum is seemingly responsible for an epidemic of disease in her city. Bente is understandably keen to obtain the emergency medical supplies Isabel Sarmento has on offer.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3144</GUID><Text>My assorted pets have such a healthy appetite, they go berserk for boiled potatoes! I really can't keep up with them! Please, bring me as many as you can!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3156</GUID><Text>Pigs are one of my favourite animals - so intelligent and cuddlesome! I fear most people just don't understand them. Oh, yes! How about we organise a parade to spread some goodwill for the little piggies!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3582</GUID><Text>I cannot risk building a steelworks when this island is home to the Ebony Jewelwing - the soot would smudge their delicate little wings! Perhaps I could buy my beams from you instead?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3676</GUID><Text>I love visiting the orphans, but it always breaks my heart... They're only children, they should be playing and scoffing sweets! I'd like to give them a treat - could I sneak some from your pantry?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3675</GUID><Text>You should have seen their innocent, hungry eyes... I just had to give them all the bread we had! It didn't even occur to me that my people need it too...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3856</GUID><Text>I need some new sails before I can set out! What happened to the old ones? Well... all those poor people were out in the cold, so I had to think quickly!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3857</GUID><Text>I normally prefer to live on nuts and fruits, but the captain is right - we can't venture out on a polar expedition without plenty of fatty food. Would you happen to have any canned food we could use?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3858</GUID><Text>I cannot believe I've been wearing leather boots when they could have been made of caoutchouc all along! If you were able to bring me some, you might help prevent the needless loss of animal lives...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3163</GUID><Text>I cannot simply look away from the red trail whalers leave in their wake. Quickly! Sink their ship while I entertain the crew at my harbour!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3160</GUID><Text>My expedition crashed during a storm! The crew saved their own lives, but they couldn't take the hyacinth macaws with them! Please, please - save them before it's too late!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3181</GUID><Text>What a terrible tragedy! A visitor's ship has capsized! We cannot stand idle - we must help the passengers!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3842</GUID><Text>Poor sailors' superstitions drove them to throw my precious relics overboard. Please retrieve the lost cargo before it's lost forever! I can take any silly curse they bear.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>4081</GUID><Text>Our oceans are becoming more and more cluttered by the day! I fear for the marine life... Clean up with me, and people will surely start to follow our example!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3894</GUID><Text>I know my advisors only want the best for me, but sometimes they can be so... bothersome. They insist I shouldn't go alone on my expeditions. Please, would you sail with me a little bit, just to set their minds at ease?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>4097</GUID><Text>Cousin Alva had to cut her visit short - apparently the poor thing is allergic to my pets! You should have seen her face when she opened the door to their welcome chorus! Could you see her home for me, perhaps?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18306</GUID><Text>My museum is coming along rather nicely, but as with everything, it can always be improved! If you could spare the time, I'd like to hang some pictures of my artefacts around the gallery - but I'll need a photographer first...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18338</GUID><Text>I know why you haven't built a zoo; you're worried it would be cruel. I felt the same, until I realised my zoo could protect endangered species from extinction! Not to mention educating people of all walks of life about the joy of the wilderness!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18339</GUID><Text>Why don't you build a museum? I have so many fascinating artefacts I could give you if you did! It's terrible, really - the display cabinets are so stuffed, I'm forced to keep most of my collection in a dusty undercroft...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18343</GUID><Text>I will not make a habit of interfering with nature, but I have heard the winter is likely to be particularly hard this year. As such, I'd prefer if the animals on my island were kept safe in the comfort of my zoo until the weather improves. Please say you're able to help?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18345</GUID><Text>Madame Kahina has recently imported some exotic animals, and I've decided I shall be the one to take care of them. They'll need a great deal of love, since they're all so far from home. Sadly, my ships are all on expeditions at the moment, so I wondered if you might collect them for me?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18352</GUID><Text>Here to collect Bente's animals? But you're three days early! They're still in their crates! If you want them now, you'll have to find them yourself.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18359</GUID><Text>Everyone needs love in their lives, and animals give it freely! Please, take care of this dear little cat. Since he's grown, I find I don't have quite so much time for him anymore. He is rather big these days, but I'm sure he'll make you very happy!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18360</GUID><Text>I'm back! I think that might just have been my best expedition yet. We would have been completely lost without the local guide, but instead we saw emerald forest weighed down with serpents; a funny sandy thingy where I sadly lost a few men; and in the end we found an enormous treasure! Here you go, you can have it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18362</GUID><Text>A lack of material wealth should never hold us back from doing great deeds! I want to donate a small amount to help keep you on your feet. Sometimes when we run a little short on funds, we worry about relying too much on others. All I intend with this gift is to negate that sort of awkwardness in the future.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18381</GUID><Text>Princess Qing tells me that some heirlooms belonging to her forefathers remain locked away at High Clarence Hall, and the Emperor has written to the Queen several times to ask for them back. I know it's naughty, but if you could somehow get them to the Princess, the world would be a better place for it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18382</GUID><Text>Dear Mr. Smith always keeps an eye out for mistreated animals, and sends them to me by sea. Unfortunately, this time, they seem unusually late. Something must have happened... Do you also have George's compassion? Could you rescue them for me?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18391</GUID><Text>My advisors always remind me how indecent it is for a young, wealthy lady like me to remain single. They've found a perfect suitor in Mr Bingle, apparently - a man I know nothing about. I suppose I should at least meet him. Perhaps Sir Archibald might introduce us?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18392</GUID><Text>"Mr . Bingle is a correct man who enjoys the hunt, and owns a textile business". Is it awful to say he doesn't sound too much fun? Well, perhaps I shouldn't judge just yet. If I'm to meet him at Sir Archibald's garden party, I'll need some dresses from the Emporium Exotique.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18393</GUID><Text>I'm afraid you arrived just as Mr. Bingle left. He said nice things about my dresses, but not the company I keep. I am not to meet with Alonso any more, he says. *sobs*. But as Sir Archibald says, it's probably for my own good. Anyway, I must go, or I shall be late for the garden party...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18394</GUID><Text>I keep hearing about Mr. Bingle. It makes me excited to finally meet him! BRING HIM TO ME! Hehe. Ahh, poor Bente - all these people around her, telling her what to do. She's just like a bird in one of those cages, eh?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18395</GUID><Text>It's funny. Mr. Bingle confessed to me that he has no interest in Bente - only her pigs. See for yourself, he's rolling out there in the mud right now. I'm sure she'd love to see a photograph?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18396</GUID><Text>Our dear child is ready for marriage? And to Mr. Bingle of all people? Well, please do give her this letter: an invitation to our little garden party, at which said Mr. Bingle will also be present.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18397</GUID><Text>Meet Graves? Fine! If he wants to meet, w-w-why not? If he thinks this will scare me away from Miss Jorgensen, he's very much mistaken.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18398</GUID><Text>Oh, this photograph is horrid! Did you take it? I mean, I adore animals, but not like this! How can I forgive myself for almost breaking ties with Alonso? He's proven once again to be the only *very* close friend I have.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18402</GUID><Text>Beryl seems to have done a wonderful job of teaching these street children good manners. I'm sure the Queen would be delighted to have them stay at the palace for a short time — it could help fulfil some of the promises to help the poor she's made as of late.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18403</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald didn't grimace too heavily as he announced the Queen had agreed to let the street children stay over at High Clarence Hall. Can you make sure they have a lovely, safe trip? I promised Beryl I'd take good care of them, you see.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18404</GUID><Text>I have written to Sir Archibald to apologise for the behaviour of the street children at the palace. Please, could you deliver my message? If Archie asks, tell him Beryl's agreed to pay any damages she can, though she did say that she isn't a woman of great family wealth. If the repairs are very expensive, it may be beyond her.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18405</GUID><Text>Oh Bente, you poor dear soul! Those children weren't merely a menace, they were a highly-organised gang of thieves! There's not a bit of silver cutlery left in all of High Clarence Hall!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18414</GUID><Text>§--18414--§</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18415</GUID><Text>§--18415--§</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18416</GUID><Text>§--18416--§</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18422</GUID><Text>The expedition to the ruins of the sun worshippers should have been back weeks ago! I do remember they were worried about a mysterious curse... I wonder if you might find them and help them?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18423</GUID><Text>Ahoy! Our heartiest thanks for your help. The last we remember, we were aboard our ship, carrying the sarcophagus we found in the cave of the sun worshippers. Then everything went black... I wonder if there are any clues nearby? I'll bet it was the curse...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18424</GUID><Text>Ah, I remember it all now! As we left the sunlit reef, the whale seemed angry and lashed out with its tail. Our helmsman must have panicked, as that's when we were wrecked! But that doesn't explain what happened to the artefact - or where the missing crew of the little boat went...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18425</GUID><Text>I warned you about the curse! The artefact, it must be destroyed! Bente won't listen to an old sea dog like me - she'll put it on display, God forbid! For all our sakes, destroy it and end this blight!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18426</GUID><Text>Oh, dear me! No sooner was the mummy exhibit opened to the public than a wave of disease seemed to wash over my lovely, happy city! Miss Sarmento has promised to find me some emergency supplies - please, you must help!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18427</GUID><Text>Now I remember! It was our helmsman! He seemed on edge from the moment we departed the caves. No sooner had we left port than he steered us into a reef!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18428</GUID><Text>Some of the crew went out on a dive to recover our navigation equipment... But when we winched them back up, all we found were severed cables! It's the curse, I tells yer!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18429</GUID><Text>This monster! That explains the dreadful eerie noise we heard in the darkness, but it doesn't explain how we came to be wrecked here...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18441</GUID><Text>A curse? Oh, how silly! Well, I'm glad neither of us believe in all that nonsense. Really, it isn't very fair on all those ancient civilisations that we always assume their legacies are nothing more than traps and curses. I shall immediately place this wonderful artefact on display for all to see!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18445</GUID><Text>Thank you for saving my people! I don't know how I shall ever thank you. Curse or coincidence, I promise to be a little more careful in the future. The lives of the living are worth more than anything else. Please, take this vile mummy with you - I don't want to see it ever again!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>21736</GUID><Text>Look for the wild animals in the mountains on Bente's main island.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16430</GUID><Text>I was elated with your western method of preserving edibles in metal boxes, but I cannot help but taste the tang of brass in the ones we produce... Is there a secret to it that is lost on me? I desire to savour the difference in your canned food.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16431</GUID><Text>I am in awe of this horseless carriage. I understand it uses steam to move but... I do not comprehend how exactly it is done! I need to look at it more closely. Will you quench my curiosity?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16432</GUID><Text>Where I come from, lacquerware is an exquisite art passed on for generation. I am utterly unfamiliar to this wood veneer of the other New World, but I would love to experiment with this foreign material. Would you be able to provide it?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17984</GUID><Text>Oh, sweet explosions of golden orbs in my mouth! And I learned you have alchemists that extract the nectar and turn it into an enchanting beverage! May I be granted a taste?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16433</GUID><Text>The brutes I sent to retrieve my last shipment from Madame Kahina's harbour brought nothing but shattered porcelain... Will you be the steady hand to bring me a memento of my childhood...?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16434</GUID><Text>Friend, did you notice the terrible storm? My father sent precious presents to ease my homesickness, but I'm afraid they might have been torn from their course in the raging winds...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16435</GUID><Text>Dare I dream my words will ever reach the Queen's honourable ears...? You are in good terms with her Sir Archibald, are you not? Could you bring my poems to him and maybe spare a kind word...?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17986</GUID><Text>One of the things I miss the most is taking those long walks through the imperial gardens. I've been looking for curious and beautiful flora to garnish the grounds of my residence, and I hear Kahina has the seeds to grow pristine, cloud-like flowers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17988</GUID><Text>Oh, no... My mother sends ships carrying "visitors"... But I am sure their true purpose is much darker than that. Please, just... Bring them here discreetly, so I can send them back before they embarrass me.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17989</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald sent me a note to thank me for the cookies, but I didn't send any! It must have been my mother... I know her - there is no way this gift had good intentions. Go there, and make the cookies vanish before someone cracks them open.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17990</GUID><Text>Oh, the delicate perfume of brewing tea. I miss it so much it hurts to remember... There isn't a day I don't regret leaving my favourite kettle back home. I know Beryl, too, is an avid tea-drinker. Maybe she has a fine kettle she could spare me?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17994</GUID><Text>I just received a report containing details of your trade history... But I did not order it, I swear! It must have been one of my mother's uncalled-for 'favours'. The spies must be roaming your harbour. I deeply apologise, in the name of my family!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17995</GUID><Text>A beautiful flower that grows in the mountains has been haunting my dreams lately. I know I will not stop thinking about it until I can have some for my flower arrangements...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16454</GUID><Text>Wind-swollen sails are such an inspiring image, are they not? I would like to capture the words of homecoming they whisper in the wind, but I cannot see the docks from my study...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16455</GUID><Text>I remember the dolphins passing by our vessel when I first sailed to these lands, lifting every shadow of fear from my heart. Had I but an image of them to help me capture these emotions in a poem...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16456</GUID><Text>I envy the wisdom of elephants in these troubled times. Could I capture their mighty essence in ink and paper...? I wonder maybe if a had a picture...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16457</GUID><Text>My father has asked me to write a report about the wonders of the western railway system and its use in transporting oil, but I am at a loss for words at its technology. Could you take a picture of your oil harbour to illustrate my report?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16517</GUID><Text>I do not recognise my father's kindness in these words, but this request for images of Sir Archibald's headquarters does bear his seal...

This token brought me many visions of home, I hope it now serves to remind you of me.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16445</GUID><Text>My sister is coming to visit! She wanted to contemplate all the marvels I wrote about with her own eyes. I need to prepare for her arrival, will you escort her safely into my longing arms?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16446</GUID><Text>I can never repay you for delivering my sister unscathed back to me. She is determined to experience every wonder hidden in this region. I told her many perils lurk beneath the surface, but she feels safe with you...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16447</GUID><Text>No... My sister has been taken! I... never should have entrusted you with her precious life... I beseech you, help me mend my reckless actions. This is all the gold I own, exchange it for my sister's freedom and bring her back to me.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16448</GUID><Text>Oh, is that all you have...? In that case, terribly sorry, but we do have a much higher bidder on this little princess' life.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16462</GUID><Text>My family is forever in your debt, dear friend. My sister will remember the beauty of your home with a sweet smile thanks to your kindness. She gave me this token for you, please accept it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16460</GUID><Text>No, mei-mei! It... it cannot be... She only wanted to see her big sister's world... I will never be able to look at my father's face again... Our family is forever broken, thanks to you.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16461</GUID><Text>I... I am at a loss of words. You do not understand how much you have done for us, for my family. I owe my sister's life to your selfless actions. The Emperor is forever in your debt, dear friend. I am.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16449</GUID><Text>Father wrote. A close friend of the family set sail to deliver an important present to me... I am afraid this matter requires maximum discretion. Your ships will raise no suspicion, were you so kind as to retrieve it for me...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16450</GUID><Text>Oh no... How could this happen!? The gift, it was stolen from your Queen! My mother's counselor has prepared a gift to appease her, in the hope we can send it through Sir Archibald, but I dare not venture there myself...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16451</GUID><Text>Friend! I swear I know not what my mother had me send the Queen, but she stormed in here demanding I pledge allegiance to her! I will forever be despised in my country, but I have no other option... I must do this for my father...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16453</GUID><Text>Father comforted my doubtful heart, but mother... She has sent imperial warships to clean the stain I put on our family's name! Her shadow already looms on the horizon... Aid me, friend!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16463</GUID><Text>Is this what the Princess Qing would like me to hand the Queen on her behalf? Oh dear... Very well - I will make sure she receives it. Let us all brace ourselves...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16467</GUID><Text>It is over... It was no doubt the Empress' hand that steered this unfortunate chain of events in an attempt to tarnish father's reputation. I still cannot believe I stood up against her...

What a magnificent treasure we've put together. Only one more thing remains. A masterpiece from the past - something that truly represents the history of the West. Madame Kahina has a good eye for such treasures.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18008</GUID><Text>Oh, a present as grand as the land that inspired it, and as pre-eminent as the man that shall receive it. It is ready. Shall we gently guide this treasure home?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18014</GUID><Text>Normally, I don't participate in the excitement of expeditions, but this time, they've returned with a treasure that intrigues me: a tablet written in a forgotten language. I presume Madame Kahina must speak every language, whether new or ancient...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18015</GUID><Text>Oh! According to Madame Kahina's translation, the writing on the map points to a place in the middle of the sea. I need to know what lies beneath the surface! Maybe you have someone on your island who's studied the oceans, and might be able to help?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18016</GUID><Text>Oh! This person does seem most capable of finding out what it is the tablet speaks of. I will mark the place on your map - let's see what you discover.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18017</GUID><Text>I wouldn't believe it if I didn't hold them in my hands... Ancient scrolls, sealed under water for centuries! I will ask Madame Kahina to study them and produce their translations. I cannot wait to read these forgotten words! In the meantime, you can have the originals, as reward for all your efforts.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>19829</GUID><Text>Indeed, I know this language: it is from the ancient Aegeans. I will write a translation for the Princess, free of charge. I do enjoy these tasks.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18026</GUID><Text>Our New Year is fast approaching! I would love to commemorate this passing of the year with something that represents both the fragility of time, and the technological advances of the era. Do you have anything in mind?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18027</GUID><Text>How could you!? Clocks are terrible luck, especially if given as a gift for the New Year! I guess as a foreigner, you cannot be blamed... I know what you can do, though. I need some fine cloth to decorate the streets. Think you can you provide that?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18028</GUID><Text>Oh, dear... How could you bring me white cloth!? This is a festival, not a funeral! Maybe just bring me some sweet refreshments, then. I don't see how you could go wrong with that...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18029</GUID><Text>Grapes! What a pleasant surprise! This time you hit the nail right on its head: they symbolise abundance and prosperity. Thank you for all your help and efforts - now the New Year festival may begin!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18000</GUID><Text>At first, I couldn't see past my heartbroken fog - but now that beauty has lifted the clouds from my eyes, I can recognise wonders I never could have dreamed of. If only more travellers from my homeland would feel welcome, and dare cast their anchor here...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18001</GUID><Text>The greatest gift I could grant you, friend, is the peace and tranquility of listening to the soft tinkling of water running from a nice pavilion. Please try it, and let me know what you think!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16388</GUID><Text>Princess Qing is doing her best to mimic the western way of preserving food in cans, but she believes she is not doing something right, for she perceives a metallic taste in the ones her company produces. She has asked you to bring her some of yours in an attempt to figure out what she is doing wrong.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16389</GUID><Text>The Princess is terribly curios about the steam carriage. She would like to know more about how it works and has asked you to deliver some to her.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16390</GUID><Text>The Princess would like to try using wood veneer to recreate the lacquered boxes from her home, she has asked you to provide it for her.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17985</GUID><Text>The Princess loves grapes; they're one of her most relished pleasures. She's heard of a special beverage crafted from their juice, and cannot wait to taste it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16391</GUID><Text>Princess Qing's best tradeship has already ruined a perfect shipment of porcelain from Madame Kahina's harbour. This time, she has asked you to retrieve it for her.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16392</GUID><Text>Qing's father sent her a ship with presents from home, but they never arrived. She has asked you to keep an eye out for them and retrieve whatever you find.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16393</GUID><Text>Princess Qing has been working on her poems and wishes to have them read at the Queen's court. She has asked you to bring her manuscript to Sir Archibald and endorse her a little.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17987</GUID><Text>The Princess longs to have a beautiful garden like the ones she had back home. She's heard of a beautiful flower that will fill her grounds with fluffy clouds, and would love it if you could get the seeds for her from Madame Kahina.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17991</GUID><Text>The Empress has sent her daughter a visiting party from home, but Qing is certain they don't mean well. She'd like you to accompany them to her harbour with the utmost discretion.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17992</GUID><Text>The Princess is worried that the cookies Sir Archibald received might be a less than kind present from the Empress. She's asked you to smuggle them out of High Clarence Hall, before tragedy strikes.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17993</GUID><Text>The Princess misses her tea dearly, but she left her kettle back home. Luckily, Beryl too loves tea, so she figured she might have a spare kettle to lend her.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17996</GUID><Text>The Princess has alerted you that her mother's been sending spies around, to gather information about your trade partners. They should be around your harbour area.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17997</GUID><Text>The Princess' dreams have been haunted by a beautiful flower that only grows in the mountains. She wants to have some for her flower arrangements, but they're somewhat out of her reach.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16394</GUID><Text>The Princess is trying to write a poem about sails in the wind, but she is finding it hard to capture the image without looking at them. She needs you to take a picture she can keep by her desk to find inspiration.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16398</GUID><Text>Princess Qing remembers the hope and joy dolphins brought to her heart when she sailed for the Old World. She would like to write a poem about it, but she needs to remember the sight of them with a picture.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16399</GUID><Text>The Princess needs help with her next poem. Her source of inspiration, elephants, lay far away from her reach, but you can help her if you take a picture of one.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16400</GUID><Text>It seems like Emperor Qing is very interested in the railway system. The Princess has been tasked with writing a report about it, but she's asked if you could help her illustrate it by providing a picture of your oil harbour.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16518</GUID><Text>Qing has been tasked with delivering a picture of Sir Archibald's island. She asked you to take it for her.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17999</GUID><Text>§--17999--§</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16401</GUID><Text>The Princess deeply relishes your friendship. She would like to give you a little memento from the East so that you can remember her.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16402</GUID><Text>The Princess Qing's sister is paying her a visit and needs to be safely escorted to Qing's island while she's busy preparing everything for her arrival.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16405</GUID><Text>Qing's little sister has reached her destination safely thanks to you, and now she feels it is safe for her to visit every corner of the region as long as your warships come along.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16403</GUID><Text>Qing's sister is held prisoner by the mysterious attackers. She has asked you to deliver the ransom in gold and get her sister safe back to her.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16404</GUID><Text>Qing's sister's kidnappers have refused to release her. There is only one way left to break her free...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16406</GUID><Text>The Princess has received a letter from the Emperor telling her that a friend of the family was going to bring her a precious item. She has reasons to believe the situation demands discretion, and has asked you to retrieve it for her instead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16407</GUID><Text>The gift Qing asked you to bring her was a treasured belonging of the Queen! The Princess has asked you to deliver it back to Sir Archibald along with a present, as she doesn't dare to go there herself.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16408</GUID><Text>Qing was set up and now the Queen demands that she pledges allegiance to her. She has no choice, even if bending the knee is against the Empress wishes, it is what she must do for her father, the Emperor.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16410</GUID><Text>The Empress was not happy to hear her daughter bent the knee before a western ruler and has sent a fleet to attack her! Qing has asked you to back her up in battle.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18009</GUID><Text>Princess Qing knows her father would love to leave his duties behind and travel the world. Unfortunately, the Emperor cannot afford to do so, and so she wants to send him a piece of the Old World, starting with a classical ship. Take a picture of a suitable one.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18010</GUID><Text>The Princess loves your suggestion of building a ship of the line, and has already begun her preparations. However, she needs your help in gathering the materials.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18011</GUID><Text>The ship is ready to set sail for the East, but first it needs to be filled with presents that represent the Old World. Qing looks to you for suggestions.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18012</GUID><Text>The Princess is elated at the gift you're helping her put together for her father, but it still requires one more thing: a treasure from the past. She'd like you to go to Madame Kahina, and look for something that fits the bill.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18013</GUID><Text>Qing's present for her father is finally ready to leave port. The Princess has asked that you escort it safely on its way.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18018</GUID><Text>Princess Qing's expedition has brought back an enigmatic tablet written in an old language. She'd like to know more about it, and thinks Madame Kahina may be able to tell you more.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18019</GUID><Text>The tablet found by Princess Qing's expedition seems to mark a place in the middle of the ocean. She'd like you to ask around your harbour, and see if you can find someone who can help you.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18020</GUID><Text>You found a diver that will be able to search the ocean for whatever lies beneath the waves. The Princess has marked the spot on your map - go forth, and bring her what you find.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18030</GUID><Text>The Princess is undergoing preparations for the New Year celebrations. She'd like to have something that represents both technology and time.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18031</GUID><Text>Your last gift for Qing was not at all appropriate. Instead, she's asked you to deliver cloth to provide decorations for the New Year's festival.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18032</GUID><Text>White cloth is a terribly bad omen to Princess Qing! You might get luckier with something to eat - something small and sweet, like a coveted fruit.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18002</GUID><Text>Now that Princess Qing's homesickness has lifted a little, she's starting to really like the Old World. She hopes you could build a new public mooring, to welcome more visitors from her homeland.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18003</GUID><Text>The Princess has recommended you build a gazebo by the river, in order to experience the peace and tranquility she was so used to back home.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17790</GUID><Text>Take a photo of any sailing ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17791</GUID><Text>Dolphins can be accommodated in a zoo.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17792</GUID><Text>Elephants can be accommodated in a zoo.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17793</GUID><Text>§--17793--§</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9914</GUID><Text>Willie wants your help to get back at someone who used to bully him, by delivering him some bricks. It's not exactly clear what he plans to do with them...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9915</GUID><Text>Willie needs help fulfilling an order made by two honourable gentleman, who have kindly corrected him as to the exact quantity of rum they agreed to pay for.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9916</GUID><Text>Willie needs more fuel to help perfect his latest conjuring trick, a spectacular that sees him set ships alight! Even he admits it still needs practice...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9917</GUID><Text>Willie is obliged to hand out pocket watches every time someone guesses his trick correctly. Unfortunately, this has been happening rather a lot lately...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9918</GUID><Text>Willie has been taken in by confidence tricksters, it seems, who now extort him for gold. Better help him out before they get too rough on him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9919</GUID><Text>Willie seems to have become distracted during a routine trade, and his customer has *accidentally* taken all his timber. Perhaps you can help him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9920</GUID><Text>Willie thinks the reason his assistants keep quitting is because there aren't enough perks to the job. Perhaps delivering him some glamorous outfits might change matters?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9921</GUID><Text>Willie has, perhaps foolishly, performed a magic trick involving a glass chandelier on a live audience. He hopes if you can deliver him some glass, it might go according to plan next time...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18044</GUID><Text>Willie would like you to bring him some tobacco. He says it serves as an important reminder of the sacrifices his late mother made to get him where he is.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18045</GUID><Text>Willie wants you to deliver him some fish oil to help keep his people fit and healthy. After all, that's where he gets all his strength from...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9930</GUID><Text>A rival conjuror keeps heckling Willie during his magic performances, divulging the not-so-secret tricks of his trade. Willie wants you to help him get his own back, by exchanging Astronomo's vital props for junk.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9931</GUID><Text>Willie could totally smash the great enemy his board has appointed for him - but since you're his best apprentice, he's kindly granted that honour to you.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9941</GUID><Text>Willie has been pressured into criminal activity by his shady board of representatives, and is now getting his comeuppance. Perhaps you can defeat his pursuers, and help save his skin?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18034</GUID><Text>Willie is yet again afraid that some vengeful spirits have returned to collect their dues from him, having sighted them near his shores. He hopes you can banish them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9933</GUID><Text>Willie's mum wasn't a believer in the five-second-rule, so depending on your own standards, he encourages you to pick up some goods that went missing on one of his trade routes.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9934</GUID><Text>Willie's insistence on conjuring for the men aboard his flagship didn't go down too well, when the morning after his performance, he found all of his props had been thrown overboard. He hopes you might recover them for him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9935</GUID><Text>Willie has been told to look after some crates by his shady board, with the added condition he remain ignorant as to their contents. Now he wants to involve you in the mischief. Just be sure you don't look in the boxes as you deliver them!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9936</GUID><Text>Willie has spotted some boxes out in the ocean. After last time, he doesn't want to risk being the one that steals treasure that belongs to someone else. Someone scary. He suggests you grab it instead - if you're brave enough.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9937</GUID><Text>Willie is being pursued by the ghosts of his past, and wants to form a boundary of salt, provided by Madame Kahina, to keep them at bay. To be honest, it sounds like his garden just has a bit of a snail problem.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9938</GUID><Text>Willie has taken a chance on a random assortment of high-value black market treasures, and wants you to help him celebrate opening them up.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9939</GUID><Text>Willie has done a deal with a rough customer, who claims to not have the money to pay. Your job is to escort him home, and ensure he's as good as his word.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9940</GUID><Text>Willie is worried that without his wand, a vengeful spirit roaming the earth will finally descend upon him, and take back a great treasure Willie once stole. He'll need protection until he can find his wand again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9942</GUID><Text>Willie needs you to escort a shipment, having guaranteed a client it would remain under his protection until it reached them. He thinks helping him will do you good.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9943</GUID><Text>Willie wants you to defend his ship against evil spirits, while he gathers his powers to exorcise them for good.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9944</GUID><Text>Willie is bemused by the reaction of the general public to his stage performances, especially given that entry is free. Help him keep those who wish to scupper his career at bay.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9932</GUID><Text>Willie can't face carrying out what the shady board have asked of him. Instead, he hopes that if you take the assassination target far enough away, the board will be convinced he's done as they asked.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18035</GUID><Text>Willie is bursting with pride over his newly-opened factory - he just wishes his mum could have seen it. Take a photo for Willie, and maybe she'll get her chance at one of his special "spiritual evenings".</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18036</GUID><Text>Willie is disgusted that you haven't yet got round to building a variety theatre, at which he might be able to tour with his magic show. He suggests you organise one as soon as humanly possible.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18046</GUID><Text>Willie finally admits that what he's been missing all this time is someone to look after him and comfort him. Perhaps what he really means is someone willing to mop up his messes for him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18908</GUID><Text>Willie has come up with a tremendous co-operative venture with the lovely Bente. Although his idea seems rather a vague concoction, it might be best just to do exactly as he says.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18037</GUID><Text>Willie recommends you invite Barnfield's Circus to your town, in order to spread happiness among your people. You'll need to build a big tent first, for which you'll need some light and cloth.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18038</GUID><Text>Wilie thinks Barnfield's Circus can only recover its former glory if the existing freak show is replaced by the arrival of a performing elephant.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18039</GUID><Text>Willie hopes that by escorting Barnfield's circus troupe to your harbour, the circus spectacular can begin. Watch out though - Barnfield's reputation as a ruthless ringmaster means he has his enemies.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18041</GUID><Text>Willie has, perhaps foolishly, challenged a rival magician to a conjuring competition. As usual, he's in desperate need of your assistance. For this trick, he's asked you to deliver a lot of glass.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18042</GUID><Text>Willie's "Pepper Ghost" trick was a colossal failure. He finally accepts he might have been too ambitious, and plumps for a supposedly simpler trick. He needs you to bring him a bowler hat.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18043</GUID><Text>Having clearly lost the magic showdown, Willie does not enjoy being the subject of ridicule. Instead, he asks that you make his rival disappear once and for all.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18047</GUID><Text>Willie tells you the story of how he became rich, having found a sizeable treasure which he now keeps under lock and key. The fact he doesn't know who it originally belonged to, however, has been keeping him awake at night. He thinks a vengeful spirit is haunting his lighthouse, and wants you to take photographic proof.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18062</GUID><Text>You've given Willie proof of the phantom that stalks him, but now he wants your help to drive it away. Bring him some holy water from one of his baptismal fonts.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18064</GUID><Text>Willie now has the holy water with which to face his demons, but unfortunately finds himself falling asleep. Could you help keep him and his soldiers awake with coffee?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18065</GUID><Text>You are to pursue the mysterious phantom aboard his phantom ship, as Willie's quest to protect his fortune comes to its spooky conclusion.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18066</GUID><Text>The phantom haunting Willie turns out to be nothing more than a few of the board's cronies, hiding under a sheet trying to play on his conscience. You should return the sheet to Willie as proof he has nothing to fear after all.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18177</GUID><Text>Bente loves animals, I know that much. If she and I are really going to have a future together, we need to put those animals to use - at the circus! Please deliver her my, er... business proposition!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18180</GUID><Text>Mmm... Still tastes... like childhood, doesn't it? I feel like I'm running down memory lane, my backside burning from the cane all over again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16816</GUID><Text>I'll come down on you like a tonne of bricks', that big old bully used to say. Well, let's see who has the last laugh now we're all grown up then, eh?!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16817</GUID><Text>Alfred and Filbert are a lovely pair of shillings. Now, I couldn't remember if it were ten tonne or twenty owed. But being gents, they were quick to remind me it was thirty.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16818</GUID><Text>My latest trick is called "The Devil's Vessel", a fearful extravaganza of sea fire! Got a bit hot the first time... 'specially for the crew... but it's getting there, it's getting there...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16819</GUID><Text>"A pocket watch says I can guess your card", is how the trick starts. It should be impossible for them to guess it correctly as often as they do, though. Just bad luck, I s'pose.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16820</GUID><Text>Asking for gold, I was sure it was the ghost, come for his due. Luckily, it's only a brigand - and he gave his word it'd just be this once!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16821</GUID><Text>Lord Flattenflee and I were having such a cultured cultural chat, I think he loaded up a few too many crates by mistake! Haha! I've got loads more, of course, but... I do need those materials.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16822</GUID><Text>I get through quite a few stage assistants... I mean, you know, they leave. Can't take the city lights and the glamour, I suppose. P'haps if they looked more the part, they'd feel more the part, and they'd stay?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17085</GUID><Text>Woe is me! Jove and Juno converge upon me! I thought dangling those chandeliers above the audience was a genius idea, but it turns out it was the non-breaking sort of glass... Oh well. As mum always said, try and try again!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18068</GUID><Text>I've probably told you already, but I do miss my mum. She might have been big and frightening, not to mention occasionally violent, but I was a real nincompoop back in those days. I deserved all of it. You know what reminds me of her the most? Raw tobacco from her evening pipe. Sends a shiver down my spine, it does.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18069</GUID><Text>...me old mum used to take good care of me when I was sick, too. I remember those days in me straw bed, supping on stale— er, crusty — bread, and gobbling down spoon after spoon of fish oil. Wonderful. Perhaps if you have any of the old stuff, I could give a little something back to the sick and needy, in honour of me mum.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16823</GUID><Text>Why'd he have to shout out how it's done?! Time that bully Astronomo got a huge kick up the interior, and had *his* show sabotaged for a change!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16824</GUID><Text>I'm caught between a frog and a toad! The board want me to off a real dangerous geezer! I'm like David, he's like Goliath, but I've decided I'm going to leave all the glory to you!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17089</GUID><Text>I did what they told me, and now look where it's got me! There's no port I can reach without fear for my life, and all on account of one little teeny, tiny little... robbery... thingy.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18070</GUID><Text>I don't believe in coincidences. Those ships in the sea nearby must belong to the spirits I've seen; their eyes emitting a pale blue light, cheeks drawn and skeletal. Blow 'em up, would you?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>21958</GUID><Text>Eugh! You actually did it, and fished them out of the water!? That's disgusting! What are yer bringing 'em to me for? You picked the dirty things up, they're your problem now!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16825</GUID><Text>Whoopsie-widdly-daisy, them supplies must have fallen overboard and got all wet. Mum always told me never to pick things up once they're dirty - but you can have 'em if you like!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16826</GUID><Text>All my props are floating away! They say they chucked 'em because they was bored of my tricks, but we all know that can't be the real reason! Something sinister is going on! It's almost as if I'm not the one in charge around here!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16827</GUID><Text>If I'm storing 'em, I should like to know what's in 'em. But it's me board, so we'd better do as we're told — save ourselves a lot of grief.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17088</GUID><Text>I paid upfront for some of those mystery loot crate things, to be collected from a top secret location! And I have chosen you, to take care of the grand unboxing!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18537</GUID><Text>Away from me, fell spirits! No, not you — you can help me keep these tendrils of the netherworld from reaching over my threshold! Salt from Madame Kahina is what I need, so I can fashion a boundary they cannot cross!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18727</GUID><Text>As you may know, I have a good eye for treasure, and I've spotted some more at sea! 'Cept I won't go and get it myself, after what happened last time... Maybe you could go instead? If you're as brave as I was, that is!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16829</GUID><Text>Guess I should have read the contract before signing, but you know, I think it's a good thing I agreed to protect every shipment. Keeps friends like you in work, eh!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16830</GUID><Text>As the powerful sorcerer, I will be below deck gathering a magick maelstrom, while you, the simple soldier, hold off the fell spirits of the nether-realm until I am ready to banish them once and for all!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16831</GUID><Text>Who could possibly want to destroy my stage props? I've never asked a penny for any of my performances, and this is the thanks I get! Just make sure my magical apparatus arrives safe!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17087</GUID><Text>I may have remarkable powers, but I vowed only to use 'em for good. Mostly, anyway... Look - the board want me to do away with someone, and I just can't do it! Please, get them out of here would you?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17090</GUID><Text>Just because someone looks mean and has scars all over their face, don't assume they're bad. He's just an honest fellow who forgot his wallet, is all. Go and double check on him, would yer?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17091</GUID><Text>Oh, where is my wand?! Could have sworn I had it at Kahina's yesterday... *Sigh*. Guess it's a good thing I have you here to defend me instead. Without my wand, I'd never manage to protect myself if it — the ghost, I mean — came back to reclaim its rightful dues.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18072</GUID><Text>Oh, if only my old mum could see my assembly line... It was only a thousand over budget! Hang on a minute... maybe she could? If you take a photograph, I could use the power invested in me to show her it during our next seance!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18073</GUID><Text>What do you mean you haven't got a variety theatre? It's on my tour bill — the 2nd, the 17th and the 24th you said! We were all really eager to come by with our astonishing new act, so you'd better be ready!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18074</GUID><Text>Like I said, Mum used to do a lot for me. Keep my socks together, comb my hair, rinse my bedpan. I don't have anyone like that around me now. D'you think, maybe... you could find me someone? Not a replacement, like — I mean no-one can replace mum. Ha ha.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18911</GUID><Text>Lady Jorgensen is great with animals, while Willie is the best with magic! This is a huge opportunity in the making!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18909</GUID><Text>Willie wants a circus? To put animals on display, and make them perform for us? To make a freak show of them? So sad that he, of all people, cannot see the wrong in that.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>21755</GUID><Text>Ah yes, even Willie gets lonely every once in a while. None of the maidens I recommend tolerate him for very long, since he has a bad habit of taking them for housemaids. Still, at least dear Lucy is a qualified one!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18178</GUID><Text>A fitting welcome for my menagerie of peculiarities! Much better than that interfering Wibblesock - he's really been walking a tightrope with me!!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18075</GUID><Text>As a man almost great as me once said, "the noblest art is that of making yourself happy". I had Barnfield's Circus come to town and cheer me up — and you should too, since you're looking so down. First, they'll need a big top!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18076</GUID><Text>Barnfield is making the tent as we speak! Sadly, he was telling me yesterday that his freak show hasn't really drawn in the crowds as of late. What he really needs is an elephant! That'll really trumpet a new era of success.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18077</GUID><Text>Everything's set for your circus!

You think I, a noteworthy magician, would not have absolute faith in what I saw in that photograph? On the occasion of that fearful visitation? I must remain vigilant.

Quite near the family home, actually. No idea who it belonged to - but only now do I learn it's been foretold that one day, its owner shall return and take bloody vengeance upon me! Only yesterday, there were reports of a shadow stalking about my lighthouse. Perhaps you could catch the phantom on film?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18082</GUID><Text>THERE IT IS! I KNEW IT!

Well, there's no point us having holy water to fight the phantom if we've fallen asleep when it floats nearby. Have you got anything to help keep our eyes pinned open?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18084</GUID><Text>The ghost! I saw him, I swear! He was here in my room, white as a sheet over my bed, and wailing madly! I threw some holy water at him, and he yelped and flew from my window to his ghostly ship! What does he want with me? Please, help me face this spirit and try to reason with him!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18085</GUID><Text>Oi, take it easy! Since you've managed to catch us, you must be a bit sharper upstairs than your chum Willie. Obviously, we're not vengeful spirits that walk the earth - just some hired hands they paid to put the fear of god up him. Here's the sheet we were under - take it as "proof" if you want.

In one, a trio of juvenile criminals; in the other a gentle pastor returning from Sunday sermon. Both ships are sinking. Who do you save?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17326</GUID><Text>Years spent in prison are better than a death at sea. A man has time to read, to write, and many other things.

Take them to Eli.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17327</GUID><Text>You know, they always come to me with their little issues. "Mr. Smith, why did you change that? I liked the night shift", they say.

Well, how about an evening with Gasparov? A candelit dinner (I mean what choice do we have!), my charming repartee, followed by a seemingly endless tour of my winter palace.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>21780</GUID><Text>The boy looks truly repentant.

But everything else he writes, I already knew. I always held him up as an example, my brother, of what I promised myself I would never be; unprincipled, a mercenary, a cruel and stupid sheep! To know what he was, it would have made mother so angry, so I told her Rafael had died a revolutionary — a hero — not the goon of a slave trader he was. Her face... she was so proud. So happy... I will write back to George right away!

You have grown so much since first I met you — the ferocious jaguar cub that you were. You had lost a brother, and I, a father. I still had the years on my side back then, and the bounce of a free man in my step. But I owe it to you to tell you, the price I paid for that freedom was a high one. I never found the courage to tell you before now, but as the ever-quickening spectre of death approaches, I believe it is time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; You always knew I had to be a runaway slave. Well, in order to escape the plantation, I had to kill a man. The one holding the whip. That man was your brother. I had to kill him to set us all free — a decision I have had to live with ever since, though I have to say, at the time I never saw it as a choice. I know I came to you soon after, bearing the gift he intended for you, your name and his on the label, and I told you the lie that he'd died fighting in the resistance. I said he'd fought bravely against La Corona. The truth is, he was just a kid who'd fallen into the slave trade like so many others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Well, that's all I can really say. May you find it within yourself to forgive me for depriving you of your only brother. Either way, I shall continue to support you until I draw my last breath. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yours, as ever, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Mr. George Smith.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>20463</GUID><Text>Click to open the letter to Isabel.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18478</GUID><Text>I often wonder, is it acceptable to do bad things if the reasons are good?

I have spent a much larger part of my life than anyone would like, wondering what it would be like to be free. That was the New World; a place where a struggle for freedom seemed to be taking place in every root and leaf of every tree around us. Somehow, that struggle for light is still going on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18481</GUID><Text>I see you spared them. Well, I'm glad, but I don't want anything to do with them either.

We could hear them screaming from miles away! Everything went quiet after a while, though. How very civilised of these upper classes to leave without a riot and clean up after themselves?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17660</GUID><Text>I received a very large order for some spirits. Too large. While the money is tempting, I'm too old to walk right into what could very well be a trap unprepared. Sail behind us, dearie.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17661</GUID><Text>Trust others, dearie, but never blindly. I dropped a little walnut for a squirrel to pick up. If this ship gets attacked, we'll know the squirrel is a rat.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17662</GUID><Text>Oh, I know enough about banks to not entrust them with my own gold.

We just had the most interesting of discussions. Nothing should happen to him on his way back home, oh no. Nothing at all...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18151</GUID><Text>Only faith has brought me comfort in difficult times.

You wouldn't mind keeping the good man safe on his way to do his holy duty, would you?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18153</GUID><Text>A lifelong rivalry will finally come to a lovely end today. Ah, what better way to unite two families than a wedding? Still, the law does say that the nuptials must take place on neutral soil. You wouldn't mind lending the bride and groom a small patch of your island for their special day, would you, dearie?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18154</GUID><Text>I like the Empress' style. A ship that bears her seal is on its way here to ensure Qing receives certain... benefits I can grant. It'd be a shame if its cargo were to get lost at sea...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18155</GUID><Text>Oh, good, you're right on time! Do me a favour, and take these crates out of the region, quick! What's in them? Haha, only ten tonnes of none-of-yer-damn-business, sweetheart!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18156</GUID><Text>You'd be surprised how many people in my circle love animals, in every possible way!

I adore horses. Specially when they win for Beryl. This jockey, though, could use a little encouragement. Would you mind delivering him a little present from me? Careful, it's delicate!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18159</GUID><Text>How sweet of Sir Archibald to take care of an old lady like me. He's prepared something for me at his harbour, but I wouldn't want anyone to believe I enjoy a preferential treatment from the Queen... Could you go pick it up for me, dear?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18160</GUID><Text>I keep my enemies close, and my friends even closer! Your help has been invaluable as of late, dear. Take this as a small token of my affection. And please, drop by every once in a while and have a tea with old Beryl.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18161</GUID><Text>Ah, poor, dear Willie. I so often worry if he's doing alright. I just can't help it! I gave him some advice on how he should be running things on his island, but I worry he might not have got it quite right yet.

Oh, how could I have been so blind? The priest reminded me of my dear Walter. He would never have approved of giving our daughter away to a horrible family like the Butchers.

And we'd better prepare - I doubt they'll take the news kindly.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18166</GUID><Text>I had to sacrifice so much to dig us back up from the dirt after Walter passed.

Bring her back, please.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18167</GUID><Text>Thank you for bringing her back. Don't worry - I'll make sure this spoiled young woman is ready for her nuptials. The groom is on his way, but there are still some brows frowning upon this wedding, and it's quite essential that he arrives here in one piece, dearie.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18168</GUID><Text>Good - all set! Now, I have only one more thing to ask of you. See, my side of the deal involves providing a not insubstantial amount of weapons for this other family, but my production has been rather slow as of late. I'll be needing a few more, if you don't mind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18169</GUID><Text>You got the weapons? Good, good... Now the Butchers will settle down. Scarlet's refusing to leave her room unless our old priest, Charles, officiates the ceremony. She's insisting I speak to him. I'm already up to my eyebrows - could you find him for me?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18172</GUID><Text>Well, colour me surprised. The Butchers sent a fleet to destroy Beryl the betrayer! They forget I still have their eldest son! Haha, let's sink them, dearie.

Still, a bit of gold can cover up anything, according to Gasparov.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16966</GUID><Text>Gasparov has got himself so caught up in the magic of the grand unveiling of his Colossus, he's forgotten to arrange transport for his distinguished guests to the unveiling Sir Archibald is hosting.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17428</GUID><Text>Everything I've heard suggests this Armand Raisin's behaviour at Madame Kahina's fine establishment was despicable. The only artistic talent I see is one for painting the gutter, so if you want him, you'll have to pay.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16939</GUID><Text>How could they forget something as simple as windows! You know, it is the one thing that's kept me from achieving my World's Fair — from reaching my zenith!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16940</GUID><Text>Are you the catering people? We'll need champagne, and lots of it. Mssr Vichyssoise could arrive at any minute, and I need that investment!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16941</GUID><Text>Within a room, a mirror, and in the mirror, the room - to infinity, but with sound! Like the groan of mother nature giving birth at the moment of creation!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16951</GUID><Text>The wretched things are sealed into the crystal! Now I'm going to have to start these chandeliers all over again! This time, you'd better damn well bring me lighting that functions!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16942</GUID><Text>Nothing is more vulgar and despicable than the sailor. Their debaucheries are an insult to my towers and temples! Banish them from my threshold!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18211</GUID><Text>I will not have my island tour ruined by pirates yet again! Those barbarians don't realise the importance of my guests being fully immersed in my work, so as to form a meaningful connection with it! I want you to escort the group, ensuring only the right sort of people are among them!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18238</GUID><Text>Oh dear... Is this really what they looked like? Honestly, I had no idea how tawdry and mundane this particular line of milliner fashions had become. At least, I suppose, I can look forward to punching my fist through the lot of them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16943</GUID><Text>I sent fifty-score hunters to capture the bird with the gilt lashes, and no sooner was it found than those incompetents lost it at sea! Bring it to me, and my golden salon shall be complete!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16944</GUID><Text>I've been hearing ever more rumours about that wreck. As you know, only the finest monastic era inks, writing implements and vellum paper will suffice to illuminate the true and complete history of me and my miracles.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16945</GUID><Text>Browsing Madame Kahina's marvellous emporium is the only real pleasure I ever allow myself. However, if I collect my order myself, I shall be in there forever, when vital projects need my supervision!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18213</GUID><Text>Where have you been?! My darlings are lost! Lost, I tell you! An entire collection of made-to-measure hats and headpieces that cannot be replaced! The last time I saw them, they were in excellent condition, and still more than capable of impressing that feeling of timeless grandeur upon all who lay eyes upon them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16946</GUID><Text>It is a VERY rare treat when mon ami Frederic Chaplain performs. You must therefore attend to every detail of his cavalcade so that nothing - NOTHING - is left to chance!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16947</GUID><Text>There are petty rivals of mine who might try to steal my plans for the tropic house of Her Majesty's garden, as they claim I did theirs. Make sure the plans arrive safely!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16948</GUID><Text>They are, of course, priceless. But since I beat the others to them at auction, I want you to keep them under wraps until they're safely returned to me. The jealous are everywhere!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18214</GUID><Text>Bath time is a time of reflection for me. I watch as ideas evolve in the sparkle of the water, glimpsing beauty in the mirrors and mosaic tiles. To hear music then could only heighten the sweetness of that self-absorption, as if my genius were resonating with the gently-strummed lyre of Apollo himself.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18215</GUID><Text>Dr. Fraud has suggested I hold more social gatherings and events, so that I remain in regular contact with other... people. I have chosen you to prepare a festival of fashion in my city, for which I want the finest clothes, and therefore, the finest designers. Oh, and there'll no doubt be a few accessory tasks as well.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18219</GUID><Text>Where are the ballerinas? Only they have the power, in this era of tumult, to leap gracefully over the terrible chasm between tradition and modernity! I shall have to do some stretching beforehand of course - it has been a while - but I hope these young and fragile talents aspire, at least in some part, to my degree of mastery over the form. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>18216</GUID><Text>I have been receiving some critique as of late that I've taken rather to heart. I think I need someone to massage my ego - to tell me I'm wonderful, even though I know it already. I keep a little circle of adulators I like to call upon for such occasions. Bring them here safely, so I can hear my name spoken on glowing terms once more.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18217</GUID><Text>I have taken the utmost care in having these card invitations to my upcoming design exhibition printed. It is therefore upon you, as a common courtesy, to keep these very fine etchings from smudging, bending or creasing in any regard, as you deliver them to the chosen few.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18218</GUID><Text>I cannot bear to see such beauty torn away from those specially-commissioned pedestals! I don't care if her people made those vases in the first place - they've changed hands a hundred times since, and yet this is the first time anyone's expressed any regret that they were missing! What I'm trying to say is, why me?! Please, persuade them somehow to relent!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18220</GUID><Text>I see civilisation crumbling in their bloodshot eyes; great monuments to thought and ideas toppled by their scabby hands. The followers of Graves must be removed from this sacred place, before they incite some barbarous counter-movement, based on nothing more substantial than a skull motif!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18212</GUID><Text>Gargoyles and meat-limbed eyesores! I don't know what whoever built these sculptures was thinking! Tear them down this instant!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18221</GUID><Text>Grand monuments are an opportunity for eminent persons to show they belong among the elite. I suggest you get yourself one - or the foundations, at the very least - unless you intend to diminish evermore into insignificance?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18222</GUID><Text>I am still cringing from hearing the news about your stocks of champagne. Have you any idea how embarrassing it is in polite society to not have a full and complete cellar of vintage? First impressions are everything, everything!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18223</GUID><Text>The shame of it! I make the most beautiful statues in the known world - most likely, even the unknown world too - and yet you insist on parading the feeble stone splodges of my rivals? I don't think I shall be able to rest until you've smashed them all to tiny bits!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18224</GUID><Text>Since your city is unsullied by the hideous statues of my contemporaries, why not take this opportunity to build something of genuine verve and elegance? If that's not clear enough, I mean I want you to build my statues on every street corner!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18226</GUID><Text>My island is so picturesque at the moment, it's simply begging to be photographed. I cannot even begin to imagine how many copies the next newspaper edition would sell based on having my island on the cover alone. So set up your camera, please, and remember that I will hold you personally responsible if you fail to capture its essential beauty!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18227</GUID><Text>I can't spare time to visit, of course, but I still want to see your monument, so I can decide in which respect I want to massively improve upon it. Bring me a photograph that shows the edifice from all angles, so I can cherry pick any ideas I deem worthy of iteration.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16949</GUID><Text>Dr. Fraud believes some bracing sea air will do me good. He thinks I spend too long cooped up in my bureau, poring over my magnum opus. Can you show me the sort of place he's talking about?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16950</GUID><Text>What if I were lost to these waves forever!? Gasparov, drowned and forgotten?! Reunite me with the shore this instant, or I shall never forgive you!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18239</GUID><Text>I don't deal in fine art. Too cutthroat for me - these days, at least. But I do know some art merchants that were almost certainly involved.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18240</GUID><Text>It was such a relief to have my paintings returned to me - thank you! Indeed, you may have arrived at the perfect time, as I think I've finished my portrait of Gasparov. Here!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18241</GUID><Text>What? What is this!? A crude and vulgar piece of amateur sketchwork!? But I had it on good authority that this Van Ruff was a real talent! Seems to me that he is nothing but an impostor on the art scene, with the hand and eye of a labourer! If you dare speak a word to anyone of this indignity, this travesty of a painting, so help me!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18228</GUID><Text>It's the name that I like more than anything: Van Ruff. I haven't seen any of his work, but from the reports of Sir Archibald, I'd be a fool not to have him attempt my portrait! Bring him here, so I may sit for him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18229</GUID><Text>The heathen is refusing to paint me! Something about not showing his work in public again after thieves stole his paintings! Excuses, excuses and yet more excuses! Return Van Ruff's paintings to him, and I will have my portrait!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18230</GUID><Text>Those artless brigands have already sold off Van Ruff's pieces, and at ludicrous valuations! I can only think Madame Kahina might have some knowledge of the movements and whereabouts of work of that magnitude.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18231</GUID><Text>Finally, with most of his work returned, Van Ruff has agreed to paint me. He is in the mountains at the moment, finalising his sketchwork. I'm very busy, as always - can you check in and see how things are progressing?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18232</GUID><Text>I have heard rumour of a tailor who can produce the most fabulous garments from the humblest of materials. I've always admired good clothes, so please, could you bring her here.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18233</GUID><Text>She's quite something that tailor. You see, the material she showed me is luminous enough to be almost imperceptible, so finely woven it is. Of course, she says she'll rely only on the finest materials - as the best always do - when fashioning me a costume of my very own to wear. Would you hurry along and source the materials she needs?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18234</GUID><Text>The tailor says it looks absolutely perfect on me! Perfect! Everyone I've shown it to has lowered their heads, in what can only be described as deference to the divine! No matter that it was so expensive - what matters now is that I am so photogenic! Please, capture me on film, so that the world may embrace the emperor's new look!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16967</GUID><Text>My Colossus! A true successor to the giant sculptures of classical tradition, and perhaps the work closest to my heart — it is made of stone, after all. The Queen herself has asked for it to be built at High Clarence Hall. The sketches are finished, the bozzettos made - now, I just need materials. First, for the foundation...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16968</GUID><Text>I cannot hope to outdo the greatest sculptures of all time without utilising the best possible sculptor. Perhaps Armand Raisin can be found - as the best always are - at that delightful emporium.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16969</GUID><Text>You must see Armand released! It's inevitable that he is on edge when he's had so little stimulation! As you know, however, I have the perfect antidote in mind — my Colossus!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16970</GUID><Text>My Colossus must be indulgent. Lavish! An excess of gold will make up for almost any slips that Raisin has made. I should never have permitted him to work in such a bohemian manner!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16971</GUID><Text>My Colossus... Finally, it's finished! Finally, I shall take my place amongst the select pantheon of architects. And you... you... Yes, well, you may bask beneath my golden rays - once you've ferried the dignitaries to their private viewing at High Clarence Hall.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17427</GUID><Text>You looking for Raisin? He's back on the green fairy again... Caused such a ruckus, they had to take him down the cells.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17843</GUID><Text>Look for the sculptor on Madame Kahina's island. He is in the gardens, close to the huntress statue.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>2381</GUID><Text>"I am awaiting new police officers..."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>2382</GUID><Text>"You might want to get an impression how your facilities work"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>2384</GUID><Text>"These sails will help you to deliver stuff in time"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17489</GUID><Text>Carl doesn't believe you've progressed far enough to need all the bricks you're producing, so he wants to keep them for himself.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17490</GUID><Text>Carl finds chocolate disgusting, but knows how important it is for hob-nobbing with the rich and influential at his soirées.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17491</GUID><Text>Carl would like you to bring him some heavy armaments, believing shows of force are an important tactic in keeping his workers quiet and obedient.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17492</GUID><Text>Carl wants you to deliver some quartz sand, so that he can make his workers' gruel go further. Ideally, he hopes it'll make it seem so unappetising that his workers will forgo eating entirely.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17502</GUID><Text>Carl has devised a scheme to sell brass as gold. It seems to be going so well, he wants you to bring him some more of the stuff.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17539</GUID><Text>Carl is so mean, he even wants to charge his workers for the clothes they work in. He thinks if they come from you, his workers won't join up the dots and see how unfair that is.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17555</GUID><Text>Carl has no scruples about tricking his workers into working longer by installing some light bulbs. He just needs you to bring him some, so he can get to work.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17616</GUID><Text>Carl's initial plans have stalled due to a shortage of timber. He demands you bring him some, since you probably have access to plenty.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17617</GUID><Text>Carl seems to be building a vault in the mountains with the intent of hoarding his ill-gotten gains. By providing wood and steel, you would be helping him connect the vault to his empire by rail.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18662</GUID><Text>Carl has become acquainted with a very nice old lady, who just so happens to be extremely rich. With no husband or children to take care of her, Carl has offered to step in and help. He'd like you to organise a gift of coffee, so he can keep her company in the afternoons.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18663</GUID><Text>Carl is running out of patience looking for gold in the New World, and would like you to deliver some dynamite to him to speed up the process.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17619</GUID><Text>Carl has identified a threat to his business in the shape of up and coming competitor, Cuthbert and Co. He thinks sinking one of their key shipments might just have the same effect on their prospects.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17620</GUID><Text>Carl is denying any knowledge of a debt that someone claims he owes. Rather than pay it off, Carl asks if you could make the matter go away - whatever that may mean.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17621</GUID><Text>Carl is furious that a group of workers are trying to start a trade union to protest against their mistreatment. Fearing for their lives, they're conducting their meeting out at sea.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17622</GUID><Text>Carl is disappointed that news of his cities being polluted is being reported in a local news outlet. He wants you to put these hurtful stories to bed, once and for all.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17623</GUID><Text>Carl has been snubbed in business. He wants you to hunt down the one who outbid him, so that he'll get the contract instead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18664</GUID><Text>Carl has heard one of his vessels has been wrecked at sea. Blaming it on the sailors, he asks that you ignore any survivors and just recover what's left of the cargo.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18665</GUID><Text>Carl has noticed that his shoreline looks a little dirty, and would like your help in a beachcombing effort to clean the place up.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18666</GUID><Text>Carl has concocted an insurance fraud, which requires you to destroy two of his empty ships and keep some sort of evidence of the accident. He then intends to submit a claim for both ships, as if they were fully laden with goods...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18667</GUID><Text>Carl has lost a ship in imperial waters, and seems to think this makes the accident the fault of the Queen. He wants you to gather what remains of the ship to support his legal case against the crown.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18668</GUID><Text>Carl's police have identified the instigators of a recent riot in his settlement, and he wants you to escort them through the angry crowd to jail.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18669</GUID><Text>Carl thinks he's found a machine that will greatly increase the profits from his factories, but he's afraid others may want to steal the secret designs - unless you can protect them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18670</GUID><Text>Carl is astonished at your shortage of banks. He wants you to build more - not just for your sake, but for the sake of the economy!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18671</GUID><Text>Carl is disgusted to hear that the Royal Council intends to pass a law that reduces working hours, and wants you to secretly replace the proposed edict with an idea of his own.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18672</GUID><Text>Carl is looking for an island in the New World with gold on it, and would like you to take a photograph if you find one.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18685</GUID><Text>Carl has managed to pass a local bylaw that lets labourers work from a younger age, and recommends you do the same.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18687</GUID><Text>In order to assess your worth, Carl wants to know if you can sustain a healthy balance in your business ventures - or if you really are as incompetent with money as he always thought.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18679</GUID><Text>It's dawned on Carl that his letter of proposal to Bente Jorgensen may never have arrived, and he urges you to deliver a replacement.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18681</GUID><Text>Not content to read between the lines of Bente's letter, Carl assumes she's playing hard-to-get.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18682</GUID><Text>Not to be denied, Carl decides to make a second dress to woo Bente, this time like the sky at night as she described.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18683</GUID><Text>Desperate to be rid of Carl Von Malching's greasy advances, Bente asks you to deliver a letter to Carl. In it, she tells Carl she will marry him, but only on the condition that he renounces his family name, and any claims to any titles he may have.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18688</GUID><Text>Due no doubt to some insider tip-off, Carl believes the price of cigars is about to go through the roof, and wants to get his ships to Madame Kahina's unhindered so that he can buy up all her stock.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18689</GUID><Text>Carl bought his cigars from Kahina, thanks to the escort you provided, and now he thinks it's time to sell. He wants you to do it for him, though one can't help but think there's something funny going on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18690</GUID><Text>Carl's cigars turned out to be imitations made of wax. Understandably, his clients are not too happy about it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18691</GUID><Text>The Queen and Sir Archibald appear to be ignoring Carl's claims to the title of Baron. He asks you, as a fellow person of standing, to make the case to Archie on his behalf, along with a pleading letter.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18692</GUID><Text>Carl confesses that the documents Sir Archibald needs in order to verify his claim to a barony are still lost in the nearby mountains, where his first wife had her carriage... accident. He wants to avoid going up there himself.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18693</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald seems satisfied with the basic evidence of Carl's claim to a barony. However, he wants proof Carl will come to the aid of the Queen in her hour of need.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18694</GUID><Text>Upon hearing that all he needs in order to claim his barony is for his old family castle to be restored, Carl asks you to fetch some materials so he can start building right away.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18695</GUID><Text>Realising he can't afford to restore the family castle, Carl asks you to photograph something else instead, and take it to Archie pretending it's just part of the refurbishment.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18696</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald is finally ready to admit that Carl can have his barony. All that remains is for you to escort Von Malching to the ceremony.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3137</GUID><Text>You, lumberjack, bring me more timber! There's a bottleneck in my prime opening strategy, and I keep running low. House Von Malching used to own entire forests, until the state repossessed them!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>2385</GUID><Text>Choo-choo! The locomotive of progress splinters the bones of inefficiency! Deliver wood and steel, or I shall derail with impatience!'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3095</GUID><Text>I'm always aware about security in my realm...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3583</GUID><Text>I happen to need all the bricks I can find for a gigantic smog of new factories! Besides, what ambitions could someone like you possibly have for some bricks?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3586</GUID><Text>With plenty of potent cannons dotted about, my workers will remember their place, and my profits will be launched into the stratosphere!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3587</GUID><Text>I curate an exclusive party for the grotesquely rich - that's me - but those damn chocolates are in fashion! I abhor the obnoxious, sticky cubes - so you can get them for me!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3859</GUID><Text>You know, I've recently learnt that very few people actually know what real gold looks like. The fools have never seen it! On a totally unrelated note, do you think you could bring me some more brass?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3861</GUID><Text>If they want work rags, they'll have to pay for them themselves! If you were to bring me some stamped with your clothing label, they'd never realise how perversely unfair this whole arrangement is!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3863</GUID><Text>Lightbulbs, with their glorious luminescence, shall dangle from my every factory shack from here to Mandalay, so that my workers have no idea what time of day it is!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3864</GUID><Text>Everyone but an idiot knows that the lower classes must be kept hungry! To make sure my workers can never again complain that their food is lacking in texture, I intend to cut it with Quartz Sand!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18698</GUID><Text>I've met an older lady I absolutely adore! If I had some coffee, we could spend the afternoons together discussing her great wealth, and also, perhaps, the apparent lack of an heir to it...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18699</GUID><Text>I haven't found anywhere near as much gold out in the New World as I'd anticipated! There must be something you can bring me to speed up the process of destruction and deforestation?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>2993</GUID><Text>I don't like how quickly the trading company Cuthbert and Co. are growing.

I'm counting on you to set my slanderous accusers straight!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3646</GUID><Text>The worthless workers have agglutinated into a secret 'trade union' out at sea, and are voting on better conditions! Fewer Hours! Safety Measures! This makes a mockery of the social order! I want it dissolved!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3647</GUID><Text>That nosy news-monger has once again belittled my city! He says the air is thick with pollution! Rubbish! I know for a fact that minerals in the air help strengthen the lungs! Skewer that polecat before he can print another word!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3649</GUID><Text>That filthy swine has backed out, claiming he's had a better offer! Well what if this "better offer" were to suddenly disappear?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3143</GUID><Text>If the crown rules the waves, why have the waves sunk my ship!?

I have need of an unwashed whelk to scrape up the foetid debris from my otherwise-impeccable sea dunes!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3832</GUID><Text>Amateurish jack tars who couldn't handle a few waves, it would seem. Apparently some have survived... but what do I care! Bring me back my possessions!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3833</GUID><Text>Once you have destroyed those two empty ships of mine, you are to recover the debris. That way those insufferable amoebae from the offices of law won't question my insurance claim! I'm expecting a full return, including remittance for the non-existent cargo!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3901</GUID><Text>My police should have the instigators of those riots lined up and shot! But, it seems gaol will have to suffice. Take them away, and pay no attention to the angry mob!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3902</GUID><Text>Imagine getting your mitts on a machine that does the work of a hundred weaklings! No more factory rats, snivelling and complaining! Keep the ship that bears those blueprints safe!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18700</GUID><Text>What do you have against banks?

If she wants a dress as glittering as the milky way, then that is what she shall get!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18709</GUID><Text>I cannot deny this is a beautiful dress, but... I never imagined he'd have it made. Oh, please help me! I cannot marry him, I will not marry him! But wait... an idea occurs to me... I shall write to accept his proposal of marriage, on condition he renounces his name and titles!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18710</GUID><Text>As I'm sure you know, I am a master of the markets - and I sense the price of cigars is set to skyrocket! Quickly, get me to Madame Kahina's post haste, so I can buy everything she has!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18711</GUID><Text>Good, good... Now it's time to sell these sought-after cigars. Perhaps I could leave the actual selling to you? Though I recommend you don't let them see the actual merchandise before you've made your getaway...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18712</GUID><Text>Why is this box so light? Wait a minute... they're all fake! Don't think you can trick us and live to tell the tale!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18724</GUID><Text>I do sympathise with Carl, but I'm afraid covering yourself in feathers doesn't make you a cockerel. The only chance he has of succeeding in this matter is if he can provide formal evidence to support his rather audacious claim.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18725</GUID><Text>Did Mister Von Malching really defeat those enemies of the Empire singled-handedly? I must say, it all seems rather suspicious, you coming to me in his stead each time. Still, I may have neglected to mention, but he could never be a baron without a castle anyway...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18726</GUID><Text>Hahahahaha! They have no idea how little, and yet how much I deserve this... Finally, I'll be Baron Von Malching at last! I do hope you'll keep all the juicy details of how it came about a secret...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18713</GUID><Text>I have waited long enough! My polite requests to restore my barony to me seem to have fallen on deaf ears. Take this letter to Blake, and use all your puny powers of influence to force their hand!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18714</GUID><Text>I knew that stuffed bird would want proof. Well, the truth is the family scrolls fell down the mountainside during the... accident. *Carl erupts in melodrama* Oh, woe is me! Forsooth, I cannot return to that cursed place, lest I discover my lost love roaming those hills. They say she still shrieks my name, as was always her terrible habit.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18715</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald was forced to admit that my family lineage suggests I am due a barony. But now he's muttering something about defending the Queen should the need arise. Sounds like a job for you, not me...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18716</GUID><Text>They keep finding ways to dodge my perfectly legitimate requests, don't they? Well, if it's a castle they want, a castle they shall have. While I work out how to restore my family castle to be even grander than the royal palace, you go fetch me some materials!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18717</GUID><Text>I... I can't rebuild the family castle! It's far too expensive! And the maintenance costs I'll incur later on... Hold on, I have an idea! I'll take a clipping of a palace from this cheap novelette. Take this, and pretend it's part of the new renovation! They'll never know!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18718</GUID><Text>So this is Von Malching's family castle? It certainly looks different to my memory of it. I gather he opted for a more modern design, which shows commendable practicality. Well, I see I have no choice but to give the man what he wants. You'd better bring him here...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>21959</GUID><Text>Look for the remains of the accident in the mountains on Carl von Malching's island.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3166</GUID><Text>Alonso would like some bricks for a maze. Seems like some sort of initiation, or a test of faith for his disciples...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3165</GUID><Text>Alonso would like you to bring him some more schnapps, it would seem, to put the disciples at his door into some ritual trance.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3167</GUID><Text>Alonso is after a few more animals he hopes will help him predict the future. He wants you to deliver some to him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3589</GUID><Text>Alonso wants you to fetch him some pigs for a bathing ritual that those in civilised society might call gruesome, but that he assures you is good for the skin.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3677</GUID><Text>Alonso would like you to bring him some bicycles in order to conduct some macabre experiment on those unwise enough to follow him. It also involves his pet tigers...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3590</GUID><Text>It's coconut season, and Alonso Graves and his merry band are having difficulty getting them open. He hopes perhaps you can provide a simpler solution.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3886</GUID><Text>Alonso has decided its time for a new eating regime for his following, and would like you to deliver a very unlikely combination to get them off to the best possible start in the mornings.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3164</GUID><Text>"I always asked myself how an antler would look at my wall."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18466</GUID><Text>Alonso wants champagne. He seems well aware of what a contradiction to his philosophy it is to need such an intensively cultivated product, but is willing to forgive himself in order to experience such a divine sensory pleasure.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3172</GUID><Text>Alonso wants to test your animal instincts when bearing down on prey, and has asked you to stalk down one ship in particular. But watch out! The herd are likely to band together against any would-be predators...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3685</GUID><Text>Alonso wants to escalate a conflict between two local warlords, who each wish to prove themselves worthy of becoming his vassal. Of course, Alonso wants to be sure he only picks the one who'll be the better 'partner'.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3686</GUID><Text>Alonso wants you to destroy... him. Or one of his ships, at least. Why? Well, your guess is as good as anyone's.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3688</GUID><Text>Alonso is dismayed to discover that the crew of a ship belonging to a local warlord has been interfering with the local dolphin population by feeding them fish. There is, of course, only one natural response to such provocation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3689</GUID><Text>Alonso is looking for strong swimmers among the new recruits, and would you like to put them through their paces with a little impromptu military scenario training.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3879</GUID><Text>You find Alonso in extremely bad humour. Though he seems to believe it's already too late, he hopes you can help remove the weed that is the Empire from his locality.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3881</GUID><Text>The noise from a merchant's ship seems to have interrupted Alonso's meditations one too many times. He doesn't care that the cargo is for him - he just wants it destroyed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18472</GUID><Text>Alonso has given you the opportunity to use a pirate flag, meaning you can attack anyone you like and they likely won't know it was you, rendering any peace treaties you may have meaningless.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18484</GUID><Text>Alonso wants you to let go and stop worrying about which ships you destroy, and why. The important thing is that you are destroying them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3179</GUID><Text>Alonso has heard of a sunken ship from the east, which bears treasures and goods of interest to him. He'd like you to go and fetch them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3180</GUID><Text>Alonso compares a royal frigate that has run aground nearby to a fallen stag, and wishes to waste no time in stripping it of its best military assets.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3834</GUID><Text>Alonso's decision to place mines in the locality seems to have paid off. He asks you to help him make an assessment as to what remains of the enemy.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3843</GUID><Text>Alonso hopes you can help him recover some travellers who've wandered off the beaten track. They're sure to prove useful to him... one way or another...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>4116</GUID><Text>Alonso is concerned for the wellbeing of some of Her Majesty's diplomats who somehow shipwrecked nearby, and hopes you can lift them into the warm safety of the rescue vessel he has provided.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17073</GUID><Text>"I always asked myself how an antler would look at my wall."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>4105</GUID><Text>Alonso wants to test how good your instincts are when it comes to spotting an ambush. He's going to pounce on a ship of civilians, and he wants you try and keep them safe.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>4114</GUID><Text>Alonso secretly likes having such a powerful battleship, and wants you to accompany him on a little mission to see exactly how all-conquering it really is.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18486</GUID><Text>Alonso would like you to take some of the younger generation on a boat trip through dangerous waters, believing that it'll do them good to know the truth about what they're up against.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18495</GUID><Text>Alonso would like you to deliver a small token of his affection to the latest woman he's become infatuated with.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18496</GUID><Text>Alonso has asked you to deliver a feast to his waiting guests, who are waiting to hear what happened to their countrymen.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18497</GUID><Text>Alonso is sending you around the houses to spread a message of fear, but insists it must be done quickly, or the whole thing will be a disappointment.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18498</GUID><Text>Alonso would like you to smuggle a surprise into Gasparov's city, as a reminder of the impermanence of our species' existence and legacy.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18499</GUID><Text>Alonso would like you to deliver some compensation to a woman in the area, whose husband appears to have met with injury whilst working at the factory.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18514</GUID><Text>Alonso would like you to take a picture of Bente's zoo for him to give to her as a gift, so that she knows he's there for her.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18515</GUID><Text>Alonso has set your harbour on fire so that you'll have some burning news to share in your morning papers. He wants you to be the first reporter on the scene, and to photograph the destruction.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18518</GUID><Text>Alonso offers you one of his unwanted playthings to collect, which no longer gives him quite as much pleasure as it did at first.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18520</GUID><Text>Alonso Graves, a former soldier in the Imperial Army, has asked you to collect a secret weapon from him, which he plans to use on his former masters. He hopes it will serve to remind the Queen and her followers that they must live with the consequences of their wars overseas.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18521</GUID><Text>After the Great Purge, Alonso asks you to bring him some wood to help him light a church bonfire. He believes bathing in its light will help cleanse any feelings of ill will among his people, and to realise this difficult act was all for the greater good.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18524</GUID><Text>Alonso asks you to decide which lion to feed a La Corona spy he has caught; Jean La Fortune or Isabel Sarmento. You get the feeling he wants you to intercede more generally in matters of morality, since he himself has no point of reference.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18525</GUID><Text>Alonso asks your advice once more in deciding which of his long-serving disciples finally deserves to be 'freed'. To be perfectly honest, the outlook seems rather bleak for both...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18526</GUID><Text>Alonso asks you to make another moral choice. Do you save a goodly priest, or a trio of convicts?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18527</GUID><Text>In this final episode of his moral meanderings, Alonso has sent a ship laden with disease to your harbour.

I build the mazes with bricks, you see, so my little blind mice can bump their way around, like a big game of blind man's buff - only in many respects, one that's much more entertaining.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16876</GUID><Text>They must have more of the holy balm! I cannot be the scrying portal, the mirror to the other realm, when the pupils in their heads are not lost to the blackness of the void, their bodies not limp and servile.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16878</GUID><Text>I need some cattle. Do you ever consult haruspices? You really should, you can learn an awful lot. Sadly, I'm still a novice - I find myself sifting through many animals before I even begin to see the truth emerge.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16880</GUID><Text>Please, I must cleanse myself, for all our sakes, in the uncorrupted essence of animals. When you read about what liquids swilled about in the bathtubs of the ancients, you realise bath time could be so much more fulfilling!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16881</GUID><Text>If I give my men bicycles, can they escape starving tigers?

Of course, you'd be more than welcome to join us - but first I need those bicycles.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16882</GUID><Text>If you watch a monkey opening a coconut, the whole thing seems so natural. Effortless, even. Give a coconut to the Queen of half the world, on the other hand, and she has absolutely no clue. My men are much the same. You'd better bring me some dynamite.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16883</GUID><Text>If it's true what they say, and we are what we eat, I don't think my disciples are eating properly.

Hahahahaaha!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18485</GUID><Text>Maybe they're good people, maybe they're bad people. What does it matter?

I didn't see that coming.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16906</GUID><Text>A ship from the east. The tea leaves say it has sunk.

In my opinion, the man needs his head examined. Hahahahaha.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18504</GUID><Text>I owe someone an apology. I've been taking care of her husband for months now, you see - but yesterday, unfortunately, I was forced to let him go.

Prepare to meet thine end!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18507</GUID><Text>I need these delivered while they're still hot, you see.

Still, you look as though you need cheering up - so come and get it!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18522</GUID><Text>The Empire sent me to hell, and I came back... changed. I was stretched to within an inch of my life, saw lifelong friends roasted over fire like thanksgiving turkeys, and what for? What for?! I want them to feel as I felt.

He wants you to apply the maximum punishment.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>13965</GUID><Text>Vicente sees no reason that pirates should continue to exist, and has tasked you with exterminating them once and for all.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>13966</GUID><Text>Noting that the menace still remains, the bigot Vicente suggests destroying a few more ships to prevent any further pirate resurgence under the flag of Anne Harlow.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>13967</GUID><Text>Vicente wants you to conquer Anne Harlow's island, eliminating the pirate threat to La Corona once and for all.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16800</GUID><Text>It appears Vicente has set his eyes on taking La Fortune's territory for La Corona, now that the Queen and her allies seem unable to contain his people's struggle for independence. Vicente suggests you lay a minefield as an opening gambit.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16801</GUID><Text>Vicente wants you to capitalise on the success of the minefield you laid and destroy what small defences Jean has, with a view to conquering his island in the near future.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16802</GUID><Text>Vicente is giddy with anticipation at your possible victory over his adversary Jean La Fortune. Of course, if you're feeling even slightly regretful about your collaboration, there is always another way...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16807</GUID><Text>Vicente Silva has offered you the chance of a role in his life's work - the repatriation of Isabel Sarmento's New World territories to La Corona, a crumbling Old World empire. To begin with, he hopes you can help by cutting off a rebel supply line.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16808</GUID><Text>Vicente has roped you in again for the second part of his master plan to recover the rebellious colonies of La Corona. This time, he wants you to skirmish with Sarmento, so he can paint her as a warmonger in his newspapers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16809</GUID><Text>Vicente would like to involve you in the next phase of his battle to subdue Isabel Sarmento's independence movement. He is building a fleet, and wants you to contribute to it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16810</GUID><Text>Vicente insists now is the time to strike the final blow against Isabel's rebellion. Or at least, this part of it. You notice he's committed most of his fleet to this end, and has perhaps unwittingly shown you the gap in his armour!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17439</GUID><Text>Isabel curses Vicente's allies (whoops, that means you!), but has suggested that while Vicente's head is turned, there may be a chance he's left his home relatively undefended, and open to attack.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18184</GUID><Text>Vicente would like you to deliver a proposal of an alliance to Bente Jorgensen on his behalf. Judging by his attitude, it seems unlikely even Bente would accept...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18185</GUID><Text>The rather oppressive Vicente Silva has asked you to deliver some weapons to Bente Jorgensen, to indicate his supposed goodwill. You doubt it's a gift she'll be happy to receive.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18236</GUID><Text>Vicente believes he's found a natural nemesis in Alonso Graves - a man who has done what no soldier should do, and gone against his country. Vicente is rather taken aback by Alonso's unpredictable nature, however, and hopes you can deliver a message to bait him out into the open.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18237</GUID><Text>Sadly, it is Vicente who has never turned to face the light. To shake the confines of his own human ignorance. To feel his face burn with the intensity of his own disgust, and emerge on the other side, a free man.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18090</GUID><Text>Vicente is an avid reader, though naturally preoccupied by the subject of war. He's heard in the officer's mess of a new book, written in your language about the art of war, and wishes for you to bring it to him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18092</GUID><Text>Vicente has no time for love among the ranks, and is rather irritated to discover the surveillance information he's been waiting for has been delayed by a lovers' tryst. He can't face the tedious lovebirds himself, so he asks you to extract it from them instead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18139</GUID><Text>Vicente wants you to scout ahead and photograph the rebel fleet in formation, believing this will enable him to develop a strategy for his attack.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18162</GUID><Text>Vicente is regretting his decision to ally with you, noticing that you only have a tiny fleet. He suggests you hurry up and build two frigates, or he might have to think twice about the arrangement.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18164</GUID><Text>Vicente is mildly disappointed to discover you aren't currently much of an ally, thanks to the lack of weapons factories at your disposal. He suggests you do something about it, or the alliance between you could come to an abrupt end.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16739</GUID><Text>Not everywhere can a passing army pillage local villages for food and supplies, no! In the white expanses of the world, my men are going to march on bread.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16740</GUID><Text>I have every sort of pen you can imagine: quill; stylographic; underwater; gold-iridium-nibbed - and I guarantee you, not one of said writing implements is mightier than a sword in close quarters combat!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16741</GUID><Text>The threat my armadas pose should be absolutely transparent to the enemy! They're already a spine-tingling spectacle - all they need now is an even deadlier sting!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18049</GUID><Text>A medal, the king said, for services to La Corona. Well... I see no sign of it yet - and I know why. The empire doesn't have enough metal to equip the army, that's why. Never mind us war heroes, flogging this dead horse of an empire. It's an insult! Bring me some metal, and we'll mint the damn medals ourselves!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16742</GUID><Text>Now may not be the right time for a full-scale assault on the rebels in the colonies, but a gradual suffocation of the arms at their disposal shall serve me well for when that great day comes. Get to it, soldier!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16743</GUID><Text>They'll never expect it! General Silva NEVER strikes out of the blue, those mindless rebels will say. But I can be spontaneous. I can be!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16744</GUID><Text>One of the ships in the rebel supply convoy is being shielded by the others. I smell powder - lots of it! If you destroy that ship, you'll blow the rest to kingdom come!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18056</GUID><Text>La Corona is losing on every front, but what is King Alfonso's greatest concern? Fish. He likes eating fish - but the Queen's fishermen keep drifting closer and closer to our waters. Of course, it makes no sense for me to start a war over it. What a crazy idea! You start it. And bring me proof.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18057</GUID><Text>There is going to be a small skirmish. It's unavoidable, but very winnable. If you were to take part - as a mercenary, of course - it might just give us the edge over those pathetic rebels. Of course, you're a mercenary - you probably don't care who you kill - so it may as well be for La Corona!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18058</GUID><Text>Well, we put them to the sword of course - but that made the waters course with blood and splintered timber, which made finding the enemy commander all the more difficult. If he's not among the dead, the clever fellow must still be out there, hiding at the site of the battle! Execute him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18059</GUID><Text>I have had the entire hoard from the battle of Cape Chance stolen from me by some devil-spawn adolescents, and given to whoever their gutter-born Fagin is. Needless to say, it won't be happening again! If they're old enough to steal, they're old enough to suffer for it - so go and make them suffer!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18061</GUID><Text>There's more than one way to skin a cat. Young boys go in full of bravado, climbing over the trench walls with the ephemeral spirit of life aflutter in their breast, knowing this will be all or nothing. Those of higher rank stand a safe distance away, and pick off what remains of the enemy, before returning to their bunker for coffee and pastries.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18063</GUID><Text>You know what I do to deserters? I do the kindest thing it is in my power to do. I have them executed. What kind of life awaits them otherwise? Knowing they have failed their family and friends. Failing to defend the nation they swore to defend; failing at being real men. You'd better bring them back here, hadn't you.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18086</GUID><Text>I didn't think he'd attack if he saw me little regulars on board! Lucky they're all good swimmers. I've underestimated that Vicente - he's almost as heartless as I am. Hah! Only joking. He's a softie compared to me.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18095</GUID><Text>Sometimes, when you take your big rolling pin - hnngh - and you roll out your pastry, it starts to crack up - hnggh. Bits... falling, on the floor. Hnngh. But you can't let that beat you. No! You have to pick up the pastry, SQUISH it up into a great big ball once more, and roll the blasted thing out again! HNNGH. Hnnggh. Hnggh.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18097</GUID><Text>Mutiny, that's what it is! Unheard of! Hnnghh. Hnggh. One of my most subservient commanders, tossed into the sea by his own men. Find him, and bring him back here. I want him to be there for the court marshal and subsequent execution of his men, so he can witness how his weak leadership has caused this whole fiasco!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16746</GUID><Text>Seek power, do you? It's better left to those born to it - those who understand the danger that follows it about. Come with me, and I'll show you what I mean.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18118</GUID><Text>The old lady is plotting against me, I'm sure of it! My last three shipments of weapons were destroyed the moment they rounded the bay. This time, you'll be there to escort them, and you are to report any, ANY suggestion that Margaret Hunt is involved.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18119</GUID><Text>I know they can more than handle themselves, but my fleet are just too busy and too important to be distracted by enemy outriders. That's where the grunts like you come in and take one for the team. Now, hurry, for the hour of triumph is near!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16747</GUID><Text>I tricked you into sending your fleet to the edge of the world, and leaving all of your territories vulnerable to assault. How does it feel, now the horse hair has snapped, and the sword is falling upon you?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16748</GUID><Text>The greatest horror I know — my nephew Nicolau — is visiting again, and I just can't face him. Please, take him off somewhere, I don't care where. And for goodness' sake — keep him on a leash, or my sister will throttle me!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16749</GUID><Text>Kidnapped?! What!? No!!! Now I shall have to waste energy and resources negotiating his release, when I should be taking over the world! Grrrr!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16750</GUID><Text>I have paid... a substantial amount... for Nicolau's release from those two idiots you let get their low-born hands on him. See that they never make it home.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16751</GUID><Text>As I understand it, the great empire of the East is as unequivocal on the matter of damn rebellion as La Corona, so it makes sense for us to unite. Escort her here, but keep her identity anonymous!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16752</GUID><Text>As much as I want to blame you, I have reason to believe my secret concord with our friends from the east was shared from within my own ranks. I guarantee that whoever that spy was, they will pay a very high price indeed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16753</GUID><Text>Sure enough, the one responsible for the breakdown of the Eastern promise left my capital at first light this morning. I want that spy hunted down, and served the only sensible penalty.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16754</GUID><Text>No-one has need of privateers now. Frankly, I found it demeaning when La Corona employed them back in the glory days. In fact, I'm so sick of the sight of those toothless simpletons, I think I'll leave their demise to you.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16755</GUID><Text>Seems like you've unearthed a stubborn little pirate in this Harlow woman, haven't you? Still, she is a woman, so I don't suppose she'll put up much of a fight.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16757</GUID><Text>She's an impressive leader, I'll give her that. But since you've done half the job on her horde already, you may as well go the whole hog and erase the pirate scourge for good.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16794</GUID><Text>La Fortune may not be an enemy of La Corona, but since your Queen doesn't seem to be imposing her authority over her protectorates, you may as well... accidentally... lay a few mines. On her behalf, of course!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16795</GUID><Text>So, that minefield worked to thin out Jean's already limited forces pretty well... Now, heehee *rubs hands together*, we must destroy the better part of his fleet before the final assault on his island!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16796</GUID><Text>You have him in the jaws of victory! Clamp shut, and the spoils will be mine — I mean, ours! Then we can telegraph Sir Archibald and let him know the bad news for poor little Queenie.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17432</GUID><Text>Don't side with that lizard! You don't even have to care for our cause to see what a despot that man is! And oh, what a terrible loser - you have to see it to believe it!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16803</GUID><Text>I have no idea how that woman, Sarmento, has become the greatest adversary of La Corona. It truly is baffling. If you can destroy her supply vessels, I'll know you can be trusted to see out the rest of my grand strategy for her.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16804</GUID><Text>The thing about Sarmento is, she still attempts to position herself as a peaceful stateswoman, when it's obvious she uses methods every bit as violent as the rest of us. She must be exposed! If you could start a fracas, I shall have my newspaper pin it on her!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16805</GUID><Text>You've impressed me with your loyalty so far. As such, I am prepared to divulge — in the strictest of confidence — the next stage of the plan for Sarmento. How do we begin? Preparation! The first and final rule in strategy. Today, we build the assault fleet!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16806</GUID><Text>Now is the time, my young warrior! Throw your life on the line for La Corona, and all will be well! I myself have been somewhat daring too, sending all of my best ships to this crucial battle - but when you've made mincemeat of every threat in home waters, that is your privilege!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17438</GUID><Text>Whoever's been secretly helping Vicente is a fool! We shook the old lizard's grasp off long ago. In fact... with all his forces heading for us, I think he's left the door open at home... Perhaps someone as clever as you might be able to sneak through?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18175</GUID><Text>I would like you to deliver this letter to Bente Jorgensen. A beautiful woman should always be accompanied by an upright chaperone, born of a noble family - ideally one from overseas - who can do the difficult job of thinking for them, advising the best use of whatever small means they have.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18176</GUID><Text>Everyone knows Bente needs protecting. So, why shouldn't I be the one to look after her? I am the best-equipped, after all. As they say, there's nothing a woman likes more than a man in uniform!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18186</GUID><Text>From Vicente? Oh, how terrible! I mean, normally I welcome those extending the olive branch to be companions of mine. But he's just such an arse...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18187</GUID><Text>Yuck, yuck, no, no! Get the repulsive things away from me! As I have told Vicente a thousand times, I'm a pacifist — although I'm starting to wonder if I should make an exception when it comes to him. Sometimes, I really feel like bopping him on the head with my brolly!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18203</GUID><Text>None have I wanted to beat more than Graves. That traitor to soldiering — for which master, it matters not — tampers with the basic principles on which we are founded; the pyramid of society from highest to lowest. I want you to lure him into the open, and send a barge up the river to his heart of sin.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18225</GUID><Text>So, Vicente wants to beat us out of the trees, does he? Like his drab pheasants falling limp into the brush at his estate. No, that's no good. Please, destroy his ship and return it to him. I have no desire to be part of his petty pantomimes.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18235</GUID><Text>Hnggh. A coward, and no surprise! It was cowardice that drove him into hiding, and until the day he is ready to face his crimes against the good name of soldiering, a coward he will remain!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18094</GUID><Text>We learn the basics from an early age, if we want to command. We attend fine military academies, we read all there is to read. Only then do we have the field upon which to pitch the tent of strategy. Find me a copy of "Leadership after Nadasky", and help me take the high ground.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18096</GUID><Text>Good soldiers all too often find themselves distracted by the opposite sex. Those two lovelorn bores have been withholding surveillance information which is vital to the final victory of La Corona, and I need you to put the two pieces of the puzzle together!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18152</GUID><Text>War feeds science, and science feeds war. Let us make use of the latest fad for photography, and capture the enemy formation in situ! Reconnaissance is a key part of good strategy - if I know how the enemy have deployed themselves, I'll know almost immediately how to crush them!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18170</GUID><Text>Every day, I ask myself, what is the point of our alliance? Your fleet is pathetic! If I'd known I'd be joined at the hip to a loser, I'd never have signed our agreement! Now buck up your ideas, or I shall rapidly withdraw from this misguided arrangement.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18171</GUID><Text>At no point when signing our alliance did you volunteer the fact you have not a single weapons manufactory in your possession! What kind of namby-pamby, lettuce-luncher are you?! Cobble something together at once, or I shall tear our alliance into ticker tape, and sprinkle it over your yellow jelly custard!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>13816</GUID><Text>Pick up the new weapon at Silva's trading post.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17810</GUID><Text>Move a ship to Vicente Silva's harbour to receive a torpedo. Use it to destroy Jean La Fortune's targeted ships.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17811</GUID><Text>Left-click on the torpedo to select it, then left-click where you want to launch it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17847</GUID><Text>Tip: Take down the cannon towers around Jean La Fortune's island first.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17840</GUID><Text>Tip: Take down the cannon towers around Anne Harlow's island first.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17841</GUID><Text>Make a decision: Either destroy Isabel Sarmento's ships, located in the New World at her harbour.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17842</GUID><Text>Or, open the way to Vicente's harbour by destroying the few ships still left guarding it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>11415</GUID><Text>"Solve this and you will reach knighthood..."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>11416</GUID><Text>"You reached knighthood, congratulations!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>11417</GUID><Text>"Solve this and we can prevent a war..."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>11418</GUID><Text>"I will grant you one more chance!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>11419</GUID><Text>"You will be no longer part of my kingdom!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3287</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald has asked for a large delivery of gramophones to assist Lady Cumbersmythe in her musical research.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3576</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald needs you to deliver a large shipment of cigars to his harbour, in order to satisfy the Queen's distinguished guests.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3577</GUID><Text>The Queen sympathises with the Movement's cause, and would like to aid them under the table. Sir Archibald has commissioned you to deliver weapons to Isabel Sarmento.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3673</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald's favourite hobby is wood-carving. He's politely asked you to provide some materials.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3831</GUID><Text>Her Majesty has had some hot-blooded guests come to visit. Being used to much warmer temperatures, they require a somewhat thicker attire.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3846</GUID><Text>A much younger, more frivolous Archie Blake once bet a castle against a friend, and lost. He feels it's now time he paid his dues.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3871</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald would prefer that certain enemy reinforcements never manage to reach the Movement's territory, if you could deal with the problem.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3875</GUID><Text>There appears to be some sort of interference occurring between the Queen and one of her royal suppliers. Sir Archibald has commanded you to take care of the saboteurs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>4113</GUID><Text>It seems that some criminals decided to steal one of Sir Archibald's least favourite pieces for their ship's figurehead. Too bad they decided to leave it unattended, as he'd rather see it sink than have it exposed to the general public.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3632</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald is preparing for a visit from some southern dignitaries, but he's worried their first impressions might be somewhat tarnished by a pirate attack. He'd like you to destroy the seafaring menace before the dignitaries arrive.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3776</GUID><Text>A group of representatives was hit by a storm on their way to Sir Archibald's residence. He pleads with you to rescue the dignified castaways at once.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>4109</GUID><Text>A royal expedition lost some very valuable cargo on its way back home. Sir Archibald has asked you to salvage and return the artifacts.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>4124</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald innocently mistook one of the Dutchess' ships for enemies, and gave the order to sink it. He would like you to resolve the situation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>4129</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald has heard Madame Kahina has some beautiful ebony for sale at her harbour. He would be deeply grateful to you if you could acquire some for his carvings.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>4125</GUID><Text>Her Majesty received an alarming missive over her second breakfast, with someone making threats about 'undermining' her authority. Perhaps you could bring the matter to a peaceful climax?'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3854</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald wants you to make sure the representatives of the Movement arrive safely back home.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>4108</GUID><Text>A certain Viscount has a bit of a grudge against Sir Archibald. He's convinced his old schoolmate plans to sink his carvings on their way to being exhibited!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>4111</GUID><Text>Her Majesty is set to welcome the illustrious dignitaries of a small hilly land, but they don't seem to be the best at finding their way across the sea. Guide them to Sir Archibald's moorings.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>4128</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald's guests would like a tour around the different landmarks of the region. He's offered them your services as both guard and guide.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3285</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald is planning a sweet surprise for the Queen on her birthday! Make sure it arrives at its destination without her finding out about it!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17141</GUID><Text>An important delivery from Isabel Sarmento to the Queen has met with a terrible fate out at sea. It needs to be salvaged, with complete confidentiality.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17093</GUID><Text>Lady Cumbersmythe's research on the cross-cultural musical variations of the East Alexandrian coast appears to be progressing tremendously! The next phase will require an extensive shipment of gramophones. Would you be so kind?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17094</GUID><Text>Her Majesty has commissioned a munificent banquet for the important Antipodeans! We have, however... er... neglected to factor in the post-prandial cigar posturing, which is so vital to the success of such evenings...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17095</GUID><Text>A delicate matter. Her Majesty has recently become aware of The Movement's ailing cause, and wishes to donate off-the-record. We trust you to keep it all quiet.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17096</GUID><Text>I'm an avid wood carver, you know. Yes, give me a chisel, a fishtail gouge or a mallet, and I'm quite content. The thing is, I'm so keen, I've run rather short of timber!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17097</GUID><Text>Having come all the way from the equator, I don't blame them for feeling the chill! Her Majesty will be most vexed if we don't warm them up!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17098</GUID><Text>Believe it or not, I used to have something of a wild streak. Once, I even wagered a castle against a fellow - and lost! The rashness of youth... Better do the honourable thing and build it now though, don't you think?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17101</GUID><Text>Delicacy is by far my preferred modus operandi, but certain occasions require one to... pound the cream from the eclair, so to speak. The Movement will suffer if enemy reinforcements reach the colonies. Ma'am wants you to make sure that never happens.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17102</GUID><Text>Her Majesty has lost enough already, without also losing King Svalbard as a trade partner. The saboteurs of our once-doughty bond must be met head on!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17103</GUID><Text>Would you believe it! The fools only stole the least interesting of my carvings to use as their figurehead! Since they seem to elsewhere at the moment, I see no harm in sinking such naive work, along with the bandit's vessel.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17100</GUID><Text>First impressions are vital! It's unthinkable that the South Sea dignitaries should catch a whiff of piracy during their visit. Would you terribly mind clearing the waters for me?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17104</GUID><Text>Oh, goodness! A storm's wrecked the delegation's transport! The treaty cannot be signed until they've been returned to my harbour! You'd better hurry down there with a good dose of smelling salts to revive them!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17106</GUID><Text>The expedition was a success, but rough seas have claimed one of Her Majesty's treasures en route. She would be most indebted if you could recover it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17107</GUID><Text>Oh dear... I most certainly did not intend to mix up the Dutchess' ships in this ordeal. Could you manage this rather thorny misunderstanding for me, and send her my, um, sincerest apologies?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17108</GUID><Text>Her Majesty received an alarming missive over her second breakfast - some threats to "undermine" her authority, quite literally. Perhaps you could bring the matter to a peaceful climax?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17109</GUID><Text>We've had the honour of welcoming the Movement these past few days, but we can spare no safety measures for them. Could you ensure their safe passage back to the New World?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17110</GUID><Text>Viscount Foxweasel has borne a grudge ever since I smothered him in manure at his public school initiation. I'm convinced he's planning to sink my exhibition of recent carvings. Can you ensure it arrives intact?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17111</GUID><Text>They're not traditionally a sailing nation, you see, the hill-dwellers. They got totally lost last time, and the time before that. Perhaps you can save us, and guide them in?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17112</GUID><Text>I would love to attend to our guests, but alas, certain other matters demand my presence. I'm sure you'll do a terrific job at showing them around our beloved region.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17092</GUID><Text>I'm terribly excited at the thought of surprising Her Majesty on her birthday, but the chocolate menagerie we've designed must be kept an utmost secret! We cannot have her finding out any of the intricate little details we have planned!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17105</GUID><Text>Oh, er... Well. This is awkward.

It may encourage more people to emigrate to join us!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16086</GUID><Text>Our society has come such a long way in the past few years! Now a woman can pursue a career in medicine and have her own income and independence without it being frowned upon. My colleagues and I want to set an example for generations to come — could you showcase a picture of us in your newspaper?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16088</GUID><Text>We are lucky enough to be living times of peace, but many of my comrades are still fighting against the grip of La Corona. They require weapons, but it would be too risky for you to smuggle them yourself. If you entrust me with the supplies, I could sent them to my comrades through our underground network!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16089</GUID><Text>Many of our comrades are still fighting against La Corona, but their supplies are running low and hunger is starting to wear them down... If you can spare some food, I can make sure it gets to them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16090</GUID><Text>Most can't imagine how cold nights can get in the open, even if it's warm in daylight. I will never forget the freezing nights when we were running from La Corona. If you can spare some alpaca wool, I can make blankets to send the refugees.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16091</GUID><Text>It is a real shame that children here have to be home schooled. The experience of sharing knowledge is lost on us. If only we had a museum, we could turn it into a shrine of culture.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16092</GUID><Text>We have fought long and hard to be rid of tyranny, now is the time for democracy! We need to elect our own representatives, and they can only work from a town hall.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16093</GUID><Text>§--16093--§</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16094</GUID><Text>Ah, the classics of literature! I abhor the thought of people going about their whole lives without ever reading a page. We need to spark the love for the written word! How about a book exhibition?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16095</GUID><Text>There are still so many war refugees knocking at our doors, Gobernor. If you were to house them, I am sure they would be more than happy to join our flourishing community!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17210</GUID><Text>All this running around your city has left me starving! It sure is beautiful here - but how can I enjoy anything with a rumbling stomach? Ah, if only I could savour the view with a juicy piece of local meat!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17211</GUID><Text>Ahh, that was wonderful! My brain's running a lot better now it's all greased up, if you catch my drift. My name is Dennis Brammen, and I guess you could say I'm a content creation specialist. I know exactly what you need to get your city the likes it deserves. I'll write a cool article for your newspaper - just take a picture of your deliciously plump piggies!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17212</GUID><Text>Now that's what I call a partnership! I like you, buddy. You "get" my sophisticated palate - and your place isn't too bad either! I've invited my whole group of friends to come over - they'll love it here! Come on, let's join them at the pub!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17206</GUID><Text>This is the yummiest fish I've ever put in my mouth! But let's face it - fish is barely an appetiser, right? Keep it coming!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17207</GUID><Text>Damn, that wurst was awesome - what an explosion of flavour! Now, I think it's time for the main course. I hear your beef's been praised far and wide for its high quality!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>17208</GUID><Text>Darn right, that's the stuff!! So juicy and tender, it melts in the mouth... It just needs a nice, crispy brown toast on the side.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>20041</GUID><Text>My great passion is fashioning costumes to help bring the past to life! If only I had real images to work from, my designs could be all the more authentic! Perhaps you could photograph some museum exhibits from the old northern kingdoms, or even our long-lost ancestors from the Bronze Age for me?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>20042</GUID><Text>Such unbelievable wonders! I'm so inspired now, I need to design some new clothes! Still, I do feel I'm missing something... A breath of fresh air... Or rather, warm air!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>20043</GUID><Text>It's perfect! After studying this picture and your museum meticulously, I have come up with a new design - something I believe has never been done before in the world of fashion. But I need materials from the source... Oh, if you could bring some to me!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>20044</GUID><Text>I am so thrilled to have created a piece that brings together the cultures of both the Old and New World! You've helped me so much, I would love to repay you by spreading my expertise among your people!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>21694</GUID><Text>Those extinct animals you keep are so majestic — magical even. This giant deer, for instance, is certain to canter across the pages of my new fiction. Still, further research is needed, and I need a place to write the thing! Would you happen to have any suggestions?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>21695</GUID><Text>Those are some astonishing animals you have there! I intend to write a story which depends upon real and factual observations of the deep seas — and as such, I enjoy any challenge to my misconception of the creatures that dwell therein. Perhaps you have more maritime curiosities you could share with me?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>21696</GUID><Text>The other writers believe it to be fiction, but I am going insane! Something both terrible and terrific lies beneath our feet, in the abyss, trapped in the ice. A cult devoting itself to the same monstrous deity is gathering in the New World — I must be present to document our end! Bring me pictures and artifacts, and build a hospital to care for those plagued by the coming darkness!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16192</GUID><Text>A farmer's aunt has passed away, leaving her niece a very nice heriloom.

You can take a picture of them and send it her way! She will surely be grateful.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16214</GUID><Text>The most curious bond is being blessed at the Church: Montanes and Capitules, lifelong enemies, are now united by the wedding between their first borns. A picture would set the memory fast in their memories, so they never go back to their old quarrels.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16215</GUID><Text>The Agricultural Fair is a very special event for farmers, especially this one and her cow! She has asked that you take a picture of the fair for your newspaper.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16216</GUID><Text>The firefighters are this farmer's son's heroes. Encourage his dream of becoming part of the squad taking by his picture in front of the fire station.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16217</GUID><Text>This farmer is working very hard to provide for her family. Having a fountain nearby would really lift a heavy burden from her shoulders.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16218</GUID><Text>Farming tools are dangerous!

Provided they can climb to her house in the mountains...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16240</GUID><Text>This worker desperately wants everyone to know about his after-work activities. Unfortunately, the rules explicitly forbid talking about it... but not taking pictures of it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16241</GUID><Text>These brick factory workers are very close pals.

young heir to the Jorgensen Trust, a philanthropic venture of her late father's. She is an alarmingly friendly individual, caring for all around her. An intrepid traveller, she believes the world exists for all to delight in and explore! Naturally, she is friends with almost everyone...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14365</GUID><Text>Princess Qing is a young and uncertain envoy of the Imperial East. Struggling to bring about the very different diplomatic wishes of the Emperor and Empress here in a new and unfamiliar place, she takes consolation in writing wistful poetry on the nature of home.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14366</GUID><Text>Behind the bold swish of Willie's conjuror's cape lives a fragile mouse, desperate for the affection conferred upon him by his late mother. Above all, it is fear that grips him — of some unspeakable and ghoulish reprisal — for Willie seems to have acquired his great fortune suspiciously suddenly!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14367</GUID><Text>George Smith was, long ago, a slave. An explosion in the mine took his father, and rendered George deaf. Finding freedom, George seized the chance to make something of his life, and has now apparently done it all. But don't let that fool you — he's not finished yet.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14368</GUID><Text>Beryl O'Mara was a goodly soul once — back when she believed her meek shopkeeper husband would escape the debtor's prison. He didn't. Years later, it is now her that's running the street game, with the help of her many eyes and ears. She'll invite you in for tea, but don't get too cosy — that's a sawn-off under the floral tablecloth!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14369</GUID><Text>Artur Gasparov is a self-proclaimed visionary, francophile, and pursuer of architectural perfection. Breaking from the mirror only to schmooze with the most important critics, Gasparov has little patience for others, or indeed, any empathy at all. As he himself has said, 'Every great city is ruined by its people.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14370</GUID><Text>Carl is a repugnant, industrialist fat-cat. Blaming his parents for allowing the once-great name of Von Malching to fade from view, he is ever desperate to rub up with the nobility — and of course, to pile up the gold. His philosophy is "money equals reputation", so take, take and take some more!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14371</GUID><Text>Alonso Graves is a man disturbed. A former soldier of the Empire, war transformed his soul forever. The disdain and misanthropy within him can only momentarily be silenced by the blood of his former masters. Believing himself now to be a god, he is intent on 'freeing' all he can from the shackles of human existence.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14372</GUID><Text>Admiral Vicente Silva is an experienced, calculating and humourless conqueror. His noble upbringing, and education at the finest military academies has primed him for a life in power. A staunch traditionalist, his conviction is that the crumbling empire of La Corona - in whose service he profits - will prevail against a world in rebellion.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14373</GUID><Text>Lady Margaret Hunt's influence cannot be overestimated. A member of the Royal Council, she is trusted by all, rarely seeking sympathy for what has unquestionably been a difficult life. &lt;br/&gt;After all, she was born a Harlow — a name now synonymous with treason — but then, that was all buried long ago.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14374</GUID><Text>Anne Harlow is the vengeful leader of a forsaken band — the last hurrah of piracy. She was born into nobility, only to see her father Benjamin hung for speaking against the King. In exile, Anne's lust to destroy the crown and social order has only grown with the arrival of a new and vulnerable Queen.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14375</GUID><Text>Jean La Fortune escaped a life of slavery to become the leader of a fledgling nation on the isle his people call High Mountain. But his people cannot hope to grow while the Empire refuses to recognise their independence. With few allies in society, it seems Jean has little choice left but to fight.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18113</GUID><Text>Isabel Sarmento is the passionate leader of a rebellion in the New World which people call "The Movement", striving for independence from Old World empires. She lost her brother to the violence, but this only seems to have strengthened her resolve. She knows her people will have to fight clever if they want to build a lasting future for themselves.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18114</GUID><Text>Eli Bleakworth is a deeply resentful servant of the crown, charged with governing Wormways Prison, a depraved and isolated facility. Taking great pleasure in carrying out punishments, he is strict and unbending, believing the scum receive only what they deserve. Suspicious to the core, he will no doubt be keeping his beady eyes on you too!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>18115</GUID><Text>To even browse Kahina's emporium can feel like a privilege, so luxurious are her exotic displays. But to Kahina, this whole enterprise is rather humdrum - a compromise for her comfort and safety, and one that seems desperately dull in comparison to the daredevil life of intrigue and prestige that she once led.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>20097</GUID><Text>Sir Archibald Blake is the steadfast counsel of Her Majesty the Queen. Optimistic, tactful and yet frequently awkward, good old Archie just wants everyone to get along. Years of diplomatic dinners have cultivated in him a great predilection for small talk, which can lead the unwary into believing he is not as wise as he truly is.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>20098</GUID><Text>Nathaniel Spoondrift, A.K.A. "Old Nate", is a drifter, opportunist and inventor. His life's work is his zeppelin, and the island at which it is moored — both hodgepodges of parts he's spent years scrounging for. &lt;br/&gt;Aside from his mysterious employees, Nate rarely crosses paths with others — not unless they're willing to help him strip a corpse.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>22244</GUID><Text>Vasco Oliveira is the emissary of King João of La Corona, outranking and outdressing his cousin Admiral Vicente Silva. Yet he often cuts a jaded figure — a man loyal to an empire upon which the sun is setting. Whatever happens, he is sure to maintain his discretion and dignity until the very end.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>23193</GUID><Text>Qumaq is an Inuit elder who, given his aptitude for languages, is the perfect person to welcome visitors to the Arctic. Although his previous encounters with the peoples of the Old World might reasonably have left him with a poor opinion of you, it is not in his nature to judge. Treat the Arctic with the awe and respect it deserves, and you can expect a very warm welcome at his iglu.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>23194</GUID><Text>Lady Jane Faithful is convinced that her husband, Sir John, can still be found. His expedition went missing in the Arctic while seeking “The Passage” — a fabled shortcut to the far side of the world. The Arctic Council, who commissioned the expedition, seem to have given up all hope of finding any survivors — but Lady Faithful hasn’t. Using her considerable influence and funds, she is recruiting the world’s best to make a thorough and conclusive search of her own.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>4017</GUID><Text>Diplomacy</Text></Text><Text><GUID>4019</GUID><Text>Exit Diplomacy</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14532</GUID><Text>[Economy MetaStorage StorageAmount(1010017) &gt;&gt; moneyValue]</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14533</GUID><Text>[Money TotalIncome &gt;&gt; balance]</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14873</GUID><Text>Military</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14874</GUID><Text>Economy</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14877</GUID><Text>Comparison</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14878</GUID><Text>History</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14910</GUID><Text>Compares your military ships and harbour defenses.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14909</GUID><Text>Compares your cities' profile levels.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>23017</GUID><Text>You cannot affect your diplomatic relationship with other members of your team.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>2415</GUID><Text>Campaign Quest</Text></Text><Text><GUID>2416</GUID><Text>Voluntary Quest</Text></Text><Text><GUID>2417</GUID><Text>Favor Quest</Text></Text><Text><GUID>2418</GUID><Text>Tutorial Quest</Text></Text><Text><GUID>2419</GUID><Text>Event Quest</Text></Text><Text><GUID>2626</GUID><Text>Expeditions</Text></Text><Text><GUID>2422</GUID><Text>Replay the introduction audio</Text></Text><Text><GUID>1199</GUID><Text>OR</Text></Text><Text><GUID>14274</GUID><Text>Quests</Text></Text><Text><GUID>15227</GUID><Text>The World</Text></Text><Text><GUID>15787</GUID><Text>Your Journey</Text></Text><Text><GUID>15788</GUID><Text>Quest Details</Text></Text><Text><GUID>15942</GUID><Text>Quest cannot be abandoned</Text></Text><Text><GUID>15943</GUID><Text>Abandon quest</Text></Text><Text><GUID>15944</GUID><Text>Reward</Text></Text><Text><GUID>15945</GUID><Text>Objectives</Text></Text><Text><GUID>21942</GUID><Text>Complete this quest to continue your journey</Text></Text><Text><GUID>12202</GUID><Text>Retake Photo</Text></Text><Text><GUID>12203</GUID><Text>Submit Photo</Text></Text><Text><GUID>12204</GUID><Text>Take photo</Text></Text><Text><GUID>12205</GUID><Text>Exit Photo Mode</Text></Text><Text><GUID>12206</GUID><Text>Exit Photo Mode</Text></Text><Text><GUID>15807</GUID><Text>You have no quests</Text></Text><Text><GUID>2379</GUID><Text>Click to resume</Text></Text><Text><GUID>2380</GUID><Text>Click to pause</Text></Text><Text><GUID>2383</GUID><Text>Click to change speed</Text></Text><Text><GUID>15789</GUID><Text>Pause</Text></Text><Text><GUID>15790</GUID><Text>Regular</Text></Text><Text><GUID>15791</GUID><Text>Fast</Text></Text><Text><GUID>15792</GUID><Text>Fastest</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3146</GUID><Text>"So, what's it going to be?"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3147</GUID><Text>"Well, where can I pick up the cargo?"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>3148</GUID><Text>"Alright.

Merchant Ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800158</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A helpless merchant brig is being pillaged by despicable pirates.&lt;/b&gt; Its captain is a friend to many of your crew, who are ready to die in order to save him. The pirates answer to Calico Roberts - the last terrible pirate - but the light is dim, and they have not noticed your ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800159</GUID><Text>Ask the advice of your former pirate</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800163</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'I knew this would come in handy someday,'&lt;/b&gt; the old cove mutters, as he unravels the flag of Calico Roberts. 'They wouldn't dare tear their master's cloth!' As your ship steers into view with the new flag, the pirates do nothing. They fully believe you serve the same master! Your guns fire and surrender is quick. The merchants are grateful and offer considerable compensation!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800160</GUID><Text>Fire cannons at the pirates' ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800164</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Success comes quickly.&lt;/b&gt; Volley after volley of ordnance so cleanly perforates the pirate hull, it is turned into alpine cheese. The surprised pirates are suddenly waving the white flag, and the skirmish is won. The merchants are thankful to see their goods returned and offer a fitting reward.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800166</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The attack is an abysmal failure.&lt;/b&gt; Almost every cannon shoots wayward, giving the pirates ample time to prepare their own onslaught. They laugh and cheer, and shout awful things as your tattered ship is forced to flee in shame.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800161</GUID><Text>Try to board the pirates' ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800165</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's a good fight in which the crew hold their nerve.&lt;/b&gt; At first range-finding proves difficult, alerting the pirates to ready their own guns. But after a few exchanges it is clear who is better-equipped, and the pirates raise the white flag. Although some of the men sustain injuries, the merchants are able to offer financial recompense.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800167</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The courageous crew triumph,&lt;/b&gt; rushing aboard quickly enough for it to be a surprise, before blowing half the pirates to dust with their blunderbusses. The remaining pirates drop their weapons, and the merchants are able to come out of hiding. 'A great reward is in order', they say, giving you a generous portion of the recovered loot.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800168</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Victory comes at a cost.&lt;/b&gt; Luck often plays a part in deck skirmishes, and your crew, unable to surprise the wary pirates, must take many casualties before asserting dominance. The merchants are indebted, and reward your rash heroism appropriately.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800169</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Boarding the ship is a grave mistake.&lt;/b&gt; The pirates are too quick and already have the initiative. The men are forced to retreat, kicking the boarding plank away. [AssetData([ExpeditionEventRequirement]) Text] and the others are condemned to a no-doubt gruesome fate.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800162</GUID><Text>Avoid the trouble spot entirely</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800170</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'We're bloomin' cowards!' cries a furious sailor,&lt;/b&gt; as your ship whisks about, and sails briskly from danger. With the merchant ship left to the dogs, the crew fume at such a display of weakness at their friend's time of need.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801025</GUID><Text>Dockyard Dupe</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801026</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Robbed!&lt;/b&gt; Having thanked the generous innkeeper, your ship departed what seemed a most hospitable port. Even at the time, your crew were surprised to see so many smiling faces gather at the dock to wave you off. A mere hour into the onward journey, however, it's discovered that a great deal of valuable property is missing from the hold. You must now decide if it's worth going back for.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801027</GUID><Text>Have your detective investigate</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801032</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The detective already knows the culprit.&lt;/b&gt; "I was waiting to see if our crew were complicit, but I am satisfied they are not." Your ship returns and lays out a watertight case to the local authorities, incriminating the local innkeeper. He is arrested, your equipment is returned and your ship receives a resupply. It seems that hospitality was genuine after all!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801028</GUID><Text>Return and plunder the Harbour</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801033</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Swift justice.&lt;/b&gt; The petty harbour defences crumble in the morning light. Your ship streaks unopposed into what remains of the smouldering harbour, and turns its guns upon the harbourmaster's office. "Please, take anything!" he yelps, "You'll find all your things in the warehouse, and more besides." You profit from a scheme that has been running for years.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801034</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your assault is too slow.&lt;/b&gt; Just as you begin to gain the upper hand over the defenders, the cavalry appear. Cannons pop from the west; a slew of artillery reinforcements. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801035</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An absolute shambles.&lt;/b&gt; Your men couldn't even best a few locals with a primitive demi-cannon. "Who shall have our guts for garters next?" yelp those who survive the barrage, "A small gang of angry turtles?" Your ship sails hurriedly away.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801036</GUID><Text>Fight them all</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801037</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You put an end to the corruption!&lt;/b&gt; Brought to their knees, the local authorities admit a conspiracy in which all were complicit. "It was never meant to go this far. We vow our people shall never rob innocent travellers again!" Proud to have effected change, you take back your possessions and leave.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801038</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The enemy force is vast.&lt;/b&gt; "There's too many, Captain! We must turn back!" But it is too late. The western cliff lights up with cannon fire, and your ship follows suit. Many lives will be lost before you finally crawl out of range.   </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801039</GUID><Text>Make peace, and reason with the officials</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801040</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Despite your earlier aggression, they are willing to listen.&lt;/b&gt; After an exasperating few days, you are finally able to prove your losses. The authorities take in any dockers who are found to be guilty, and most, if not all of your possessions are returned.  </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801041</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The authorities stand with their own.&lt;/b&gt; Following a ceasefire, you make your case as best you can, but it's not enough. Furthermore, you must answer for the damage you've caused. Unfortunately, this will mean leaving some of your best sailors behind to help with repairs. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801029</GUID><Text>Return to the inn in disguise and bait the robbers</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801042</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You rumble the schemers!&lt;/b&gt; The crew set aside superstition, and paint the ship with a different name. The most cut-throat of your sailors pose as wealthy officers, cabin curtains for sashes, so as to appear perfect victims. Taken in by it all, the innkeeper and his dockside associates are caught in the act. You make sure to relieve them of far more than they stole.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801043</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The disguises are unconvincing.&lt;/b&gt; A lick of paint, and the ship differs enough to blend in at the busy port, but moustaches and a change of clothes aren't enough for the sly innkeeper. "Thought you could fool us?" he scoffs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801044</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your disguises are comically poor&lt;/b&gt;, and yet the innkeeper is the picture of cordiality as he ushers your men to retake their seats. Your men exchange hopeful looks, but the other patrons start laughing. Almost in unison, they draw their pistols. "What were we thinking?" mutter your men. "I wonder where you'll end up!" the innkeeper cackles, as he has your crew stripped, bound, and pushed off to sea.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801045</GUID><Text>Take back what is yours by force</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801047</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes a fistfight is the only way.&lt;/b&gt; The inn is a hurricane of chairs and glass, as your crew express themselves the only way they know how. Once the locals are subdued, the innkeeper is dragged outside, his life used as a security against whatever plunder you please. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801048</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The locals are brutal.&lt;/b&gt; Home-made knuckles, knives and cudgels scrape open the faces of your crew. Some are left to bleed out on the sticky hostelry floor, while the bloody remainder are packed off by the authorities for disturbance of the peace. Eventually they will be released, leaving you lighter on both goods and personnel. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801046</GUID><Text>Threaten to expose their scheme</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801049</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The innkeeper agrees to negotiate.&lt;/b&gt; "We've got a good thing going here, and I don't want you spoiling it," he sniffs, "take what's yours and leave." Glad to avoid further trouble, your crew recover their possessions and leave. One can but feel sorry for the next poor victims of this villainous scheme.  </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801050</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Get out, before we scratch you out!"&lt;/b&gt; growls the innkeeper, his true colours plain to see. It seems every surly thug in the port is on his side. The expedition must take this loss of time and equipment on the chin. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801030</GUID><Text>Appeal to the local authorities</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801051</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You make the case well.&lt;/b&gt; "You are quite right. Terrible corruption such as this must be put to an end!" says the governor, "And of course, you shall have back what was taken." His disingenuousness stinks to high heaven, but you don't have time to go digging any deeper.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801052</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They are completely corrupt.&lt;/b&gt; "What an extraordinary tale! I am so glad our little country has fired your imagination!" smiles the governor.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801053</GUID><Text>Risk implicating the governor</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801055</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Clever. Very clever,"&lt;/b&gt; admits the medal-draped governor, as he puffs solemnly on his cigar. "How did you know the innkeeper was my brother?" Your emissary doesn't let slip it was pure guesswork. "Go ahead, take whatever you want," he gestures to a warehouse bursting with confiscated goods, "so long as you keep quiet about all this— can't have my superiors finding out." </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801056</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"A grave last mistake,"&lt;/b&gt; chuckles the governor, as the poplar-lined grounds of his palace swarm with militia, "arrest these fops!" Your delegation try to resist, but are armed only with the toothpicks that came with their canapes. Your expedition must now manage without them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801054</GUID><Text>Resort to violence</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801057</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Alright, alright!"&lt;/b&gt; says the amused governor, bayonet to his neck, "take back what you lost. But then you leave." Since the harbour is now so well-guarded, it feels rather an achievement to have forced any sort of compromise. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801058</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'That was a mistake,'&lt;/b&gt; chuckles the governor, as his poplar-lined palace swarms with militia, 'arrest them!' Your crew would rather die than be locked-up for life, so they fight their way out. At least, one or two of them do.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801059</GUID><Text>Give up and leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801060</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's widespread frustration among the crew.&lt;/b&gt; "Those instruments were vital for my research!", "You let the beggars off scot free?!", "This expedition is an embarrassment!"

It's hard to argue with their assessment, and bad for morale.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801620</GUID><Text>Iceberg</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801621</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your ship is stranded on an iceberg!&lt;/b&gt; It is night. The meek light of your vessel seems to dissolve into the moonless blackness. Even at easy sail and under constant vigil, your ship is running the risk in these waters, for slumbering ice giants lurk in the darkness in all directions. "Dead ahead!" comes the cry, but it's too late. A low growl shakes the boat, as a wave dumps it atop an iceberg, which is shaped like an upturned molar. The ship is undamaged, but beached — if only it could be returned to the water...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801622</GUID><Text>Break free with dynamite</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801626</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Nothing in nature can prevail against human endeavour,&lt;/b&gt; it would seem. The crew watch with trepidation as the fuses burn down to the stick, before an ear-splitting series of detonations ring across the vastness, sundering the icy claws that had held your ship hostage. A small blizzard of debris blankets the deck, to the hilarity of all on board, for they are free once more!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801623</GUID><Text>Bombard the icy prison</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801627</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Ice crumbles all around courtesy of some impressive firepower.&lt;/b&gt; Any cannon that can be swiveled at the target is put to use, chipping away at the icy dungeon in which the ship has become wedged until the way is clear. Then, like a cheerful sea lion, the fair vessel slips down an escarpment and plops back into the water. The crew cheer.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801628</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The iceberg fights back.&lt;/b&gt; Though the way is almost clear, the relentless cannon fire seems to have woken the ogre below — and to the horror of the crew, the vast berg rolls slightly to one side. Great shards of ice detach and bounce over the deck, injuring your men. Quick action is needed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801629</GUID><Text>Get out and push the ship free</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801631</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your men live for such challenges,&lt;/b&gt; and scarcely need telling what to do. Leaping down from the boat, they get behind her, knotting guy ropes as fast as they can. As they work, the berg rumbles suggestively, but it is your quick-thinking crew who prevail. Once clear of the ice field, the crew will be able to treat their wounds.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801632</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's an uphill struggle.&lt;/b&gt; The pitching of the unstable berg does not help one jot, as the men tumble and slide to find grip. Such is the effort required to pull the ship successfully down from the iceberg into the sea, that no-one notices one of the teams is missing. It appears they have fallen through a thin part of the ice to their deaths...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801630</GUID><Text>Let the rolling iceberg toss you into the sea</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801633</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your ship performs a rather messy dismount.&lt;/b&gt; After that initial roll, the iceberg halts long enough to suggest it wants to stay in its new position — but then everything happens all at once. The berg spins violently, and the ship goes with it! The ship strikes the water at such an angle that very serious damage is done to much of the lee-side. Fortunately, the crew emerge unharmed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801624</GUID><Text>Build something to help you escape</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801634</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew assemble a dozen hardy levers to free the ship.&lt;/b&gt; Flexible hickory planking is cut and reshaped into wedges, before being inserted into the ice at intervals of five paces, until they surround the stern. On a count of three the men lift, and to their surprise, so does the hull! Once it starts moving, there's no stopping it, and it clatters through the icy obstructions to the sea. Your sailors embrace in the wake of their success — they have been very resourceful.  </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801635</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew choose the wrong wood for the task.&lt;/b&gt; They select a decorative mahogany veneer, stripped from the captain's cabin. "Whatever it takes," the captain says with laudable magnanimity, but the whole business is futile. Despite the wedges being placed in great number at the stern of the ship, no amount of pressure from the crew can encourage the ship to move, since the levers lack the requisite spring. They'll need to find another way off this iceberg. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801625</GUID><Text>Pray for divine intervention</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801636</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew realise they are blessed!&lt;/b&gt; "If God has seen fit to place us here, we should trust in him," says the ship's holy man, thoughtfully, "I would not discount the idea that this very iceberg has sentience! I know of at least one explorer whose expeditions ride bergs by design!" Indeed, the navigators observe that the iceberg is itself moving, and at fair speed, in a desirable direction. This shall make a fine home for a time.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801637</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The days melt into weeks that melt into months.&lt;/b&gt; Even the probable agnostics among the crew take to prayer, for each passing day there is some fresh cause for optimism, some sign that someone is listening. As spring approaches, some of the berg thaws. One day, a migratory bird is spotted. At long, long last, a vast chunk of the iceberg separates, leaving the ship mere metres from open water. A day of heaving has it afloat again, though your men have lost all notion of time.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801638</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There is no-one out there.&lt;/b&gt; After a week perched atop the pink-white berg, with supplies diminishing, the crew cannot bear to wait in the gnawing cold any longer. Any help will have to come from within.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802094</GUID><Text>Sea of Sargassum</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802095</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A ship in need of rescue!&lt;/b&gt; The vast floating tapestries of algae in these windless waters have long been thought impassable. Just when you thought your own vessel had managed to avoid the yellow-orange plants, you see another ship stuck fast! They must also have seen you, as their alarm begins to sound. With no proper rescue equipment aboard, your own ship risks becoming entangled if you get too close. Should you try to help?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802096</GUID><Text>A steamship should have nothing to fear here</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802099</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your steamer glides effortlessly through.&lt;/b&gt; The crew lean from the rails to peer at the sargassum colony, which is thick with sealife like crabs and tropical fish. The algae parts easily before your ship. The absence of wind presents no difficulty as it would for a sailboat, and indeed, as you tug them into open water, the crew of the ship in distress explain it was not the algae, but the calm that had stalled them. They are delighted to have been discovered, and several of them offer to join your expedition.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802097</GUID><Text>Harpoon them and tug them away</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802100</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A good shot, but there is too little wind to tug them clear.&lt;/b&gt; Having signalled your intention, the gunner sends the harpoon crunching into the other ship's hull. A fine shot, considering it was at the limit of the harpoon's range. However, the calm prohibits them pulling the ship out of the brown mass of algae, so the crew consider their next steps. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802102</GUID><Text>Throw them a 'life-line'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802104</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The breeches buoy guarantees a safe rescue.&lt;/b&gt; The crew transform a lifebuoy into a harness, and attach it to runners which allow it to zip between the two ships once the harpoon rope is drawn taut. The stranded sailors take it in turns to enjoy this rather daring form of escape. Having been lifted from the doldrums, they are keen to assist however they may for the remainder of the expedition.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802105</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The breeches buoy shears off into the water&lt;/b&gt; just as the first sailor climbs onto the contraption, leaving it dangling perilously from the rope between the two ships. Desperate for rescue, the crew of the stranded boat decide to swim for it instead. After thrashing the distance, the mariners eventually slop aboard, their bodies jaundiced with algae. "Five years we've been stuck here," one stammers angrily. They're going to be quite a burden on your expedition.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802103</GUID><Text>Inspire them to traverse the rope</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802106</GUID><Text> &lt;b&gt;A surge of belief animates the stranded sailors.&lt;/b&gt; "You are saved!" cries your lookout, "your ordeal is over!" Under the encouragement of your lieutenants, the other crew grab the rope, and with the desperate strength of hope, they cross the distance to reach your ship. Your crew's goodwill has shone through, and the grateful survivors join your expedition without a second thought.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802107</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They take no strength from your crew's silent prayer.&lt;/b&gt; If only someone had offered a few more words of encouragement — anything positive at all. First to cross is an old man so thin, you could fold him up and tuck him in a drawer. Clutching the fibrous rope is challenge enough for his frail wrists, and after a brief struggle, he drops off. His crewmates jump in with him, and commence a desperate thrash through the brown sargassum. The few that make it to your ship will only be a burden on your expedition.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802101</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Panicked sailors toss themselves into the algae,&lt;/b&gt; as your stray harpoon crashes wildly through the lower deck, and seawater rushes in through the breach. She's going down! "We brought them to this," yells one of your officers, "we have a responsibility to do something!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802108</GUID><Text>Send your best swimmers to the rescue</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802110</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your swimmers are strong and fit enough,&lt;/b&gt; but the malnourished crew of the sinking ship need all the help they can get. The algae weighs like a lion's mane on your heroes, as they relay the castaways on-by-one. Once all are accounted for, they lie on the burning deck, panting. This whole episode has been exhausting.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802111</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The rescue is a tragedy.&lt;/b&gt; Your men paddle like puppies in the densely-packed sargassum — it's hard to understand quite how sailors could be so lacking in practice. Gasping, they reach desperately towards the castaways they should be rescuing, as if for support, only for the undertow of the sinking ship to pull them under. This was all your fault.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802109</GUID><Text>Leave them to their fate</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802112</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"We did what we could..."&lt;/b&gt; the lieutenant trails off, "...and we couldn't do much!" answers your steersman darkly. There is so little wind here, it takes an eternity to pass the sinking boat by. Hands reach desperately towards you, but the pull of their sinking ship soon drags them under the surface. It will take an awful lot to lift your crew out of the doldrums.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802098</GUID><Text>Don't risk it</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802113</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Don't leave! We've been here for ten years!"&lt;/b&gt; Reads the message in semaphore. There's so little wind here, it takes an eternity to pass the stranded boat by. A drift of shame. Your crew, as yellow-bellied as this sea of sargassum, will need a lot to lift them out of the doldrums.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802745</GUID><Text>Jolly Roger</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802746</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Pirates!&lt;/b&gt; The torn black flag bearing a skull and crossbones is a shock to those on your expedition who thought they were a dying breed. The weather-worn ship emerges from the mist with prepared to plunder. Astride her bow stands her colourful captain, axe raised; along her rails, the spectral silhouette of her starving crew, hungry to feed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802747</GUID><Text>Manoeuvre into attack position</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802749</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You swivel on a sixpence, ready to blow them away!&lt;/b&gt; Quickly setting sails to curb momentum, your ship turns in the shallowest possible arc for a vessel this size — a manoeuvre only a tactician well-accustomed to risk would attempt. Meanwhile, some of the crew have improvised a few grenades, should you want to make use of them...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802751</GUID><Text>Fire the cannons!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802753</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The pirates are sunk&lt;/b&gt; before they have chance to do any damage at all! Your ship's guns target the most mould-ridden flank of the corsairs' ship, smashing it through. The antique vessel collapses in on itself, and your sailors enjoy the resulting plunder almost as if they themselves had been the pesky picaroons.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802754</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's a disappointing salvo.&lt;/b&gt; Despite being in a strong position, your cannons are miscalibrated, and end up firing short. The pirates know they cannot win this with their outmoded gunnery, and between shots they draw in close, latching onto your ship with their boarding hooks. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802755</GUID><Text>Defend against the boarding pirates</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802757</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Today is not the day you are vanquished by pirates.&lt;/b&gt; The rowdy band charge aboard only to find your resolute crew arranged in a classical shield wall, with percussion cap pistols poking out of what few gaps remain. Although your crew sustain fairly gruesome injuries from pirate axes, all but one survive. That young lad is given a funeral, unlike the poor dead pirates.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802758</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You're lucky they don't leave with your ship!&lt;/b&gt; Some of your sailors are equipped with old flintlocks, whose inaccuracy permits the enemy to engage at close quarters. The swordplay proceeds so terribly on your side that a section of pirates are able to reach the lower deck, and pilfer all they find. Satisfied, their captain bays "fall back!" and the scourge are gone, leaving your crew to count the dead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802756</GUID><Text>Surrender to them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802759</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Take all you want, but please, don't hurt us!"&lt;/b&gt; your officer pleads. The pirate captain grins, revealing a jumbled set of shark teeth, before proceeding to strip the chap of his ear. "Sounds fair," he says, still smiling. Your ship is then relieved of its supplies without further violence; the pirates no doubt bound by some arcane code to honour your surrender. You wonder if your expedition can survive on what the little they leave behind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802752</GUID><Text>Bombard them with handmade grenades!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802760</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The pirates weren't expecting such a crafty attack.&lt;/b&gt; "I was saving these for a special occasion," your weaponsmith burps. The 'special brew' he's concocted consists of a bottle filled with powder, a hemp fuse, and a nail surprise. There's a shimmering sound as they explode, and when the smoke clears, your crew frisk the punctured bodies littering the deck, singing "Rollicking band of pirates, we!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802761</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Ineffective to say the least.&lt;/b&gt; The improvised grenades are duff fireworks, and when landing on the pirate deck, they fail to discharge. There is no time to apportion blame, for the tide of battle has swung again in favour of the pirates, who have hooked the two ships together for boarding.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802750</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The turn is not sharp enough.&lt;/b&gt; There was nothing wrong with the idea, but whatever tactical advantage your ship may have had is lost with the rather cautious turning circle it plots, out of which the ship emerges a slow-moving target. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802762</GUID><Text>Position for attack anyway</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802764</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You make the best of a poor position.&lt;/b&gt; At the last moment, your maverick navigators cut inside the approaching pirates, who had been hoping to board you. Your crew have the breathing space now to act!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802766</GUID><Text>Fire all cannons!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802768</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;After a long exchange, the pirates are sunk!&lt;/b&gt; Damage is done to both ships, before finally your men "cross the T" by releasing a full broadside into their prow. Immediately, the enemy ship is guzzling water. Any plunder floating above the wreck can serve as compensation for the minor damage you've received.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802769</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is a damaging encounter.&lt;/b&gt; The rotted exterior of the pirate vessel invites cannon fire, but their movements are too clever, never exposing their flanks to a broadside. Keen to corner them, your officers overcommit, and in doing so, leave themselves open to a devastating barrage. The pirates take the chance to flee — which is fortunate, because your ship is almost dead in the water.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802767</GUID><Text>Board them!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802770</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew go beserk for the fight.&lt;/b&gt; Most of the ramshackle pirate crew fall in the first bloodthirsty charge, while your raiders suffer only one or two casualties. While the pirates bleed out, your men deprive them of any ill-gotten plunder they have. You then scupper the barque, and watch as it disappears, black flags and all, to meet Davy Jones.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802771</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew don't seem too keen.&lt;/b&gt; Perhaps they know they won't stand a chance going hand-to-hand with seasoned pirates. As the two ships adjoin, it's the pirates who make the charge. Almost immediately, a pirate swings an axe and lops off a head. Horrified, your steersman hurriedly spins your ship away, with fighters on both sides falling into the resulting chasm. Your depleted crew flees at full speed. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802765</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The navigators fail to recover&lt;/b&gt; from the initial setback. Your helmsman has no tricks left up his sleeves, and cannot pick up speed to outrun the approaching pirates. They intend to board you!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802772</GUID><Text>Fight them to the death</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802774</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is a saddening scene.&lt;/b&gt; To see this many brave fighters put to the sword is regrettable. Fortunately, the losses are largely on the other side; the pirates' antique weaponry ever more a disadvantage in the modern age. When the last scrawny dog is dead, you set their ship alight like a funeral barque. Your own sailors, still twitching from the skirmish, pour themselves long jars of rum, and remember the fallen. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802775</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You are no match for the pirates. &lt;/b&gt; The attackers pour in like beetles from all sides, a many-legged brood washing over your forces like some unstoppable plague, crushing all resistance. "I know it's a good'un, but we ain't taking the ship..."  the pirate captain is heard to utter by a few survivors, who were cowering behind a locked door, "...just everything on it!" When the sound of looting and cheering has died away, the survivors emerge to find the expedition ship stripped of pretty well everything it had.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802773</GUID><Text>Listen to reason and surrender</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802776</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Should have waved the white flag sooner.&lt;/b&gt; Your weapons drop and the pirate captain saunters aboard. She is tall and surprisingly aged, dressed in the dashing clothes of a bygone era, "For our trouble, we'll have some of yer crew for slaves," she growls, "all of 'em left of this line." She swishes her cutlass and portions off several of your crew as her playthings. After that, she turns more amicable, as her horde loot your ship. As they leave, she drops a feathered glove to show her gratitude.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802763</GUID><Text>Surrender</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802777</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Take all you want, but please, don't hurt us!"&lt;/b&gt; your officer pleads. The pirate captain grins, revealing a jumbled set of shark teeth, and proceeds to strip the chap of his ear. "Sounds fair," he says, still smiling. Your ship is then relieved of its supplies without further violence; the pirates no doubt bound by some arcane code to honour your surrender. You wonder if your expedition can survive on what the little they leave behind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802748</GUID><Text>Have an officer make a rousing speech</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802778</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your men are resolute following the speech.&lt;/b&gt; Your acting lieutenant points his sabre to the sky, defying the heavens themselves. "If I, born with gas lighting, heated water, and a silver spoon in mouth..." with each fresh admission a cheer goes up, "If I can enjoy chopping through these mangy pirates, then you lot will bloody well be in heaven!" There is a raucous cheer as the men prepare for their orders. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802780</GUID><Text>Board the pirate ship!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802782</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is indeed a heroic charge.&lt;/b&gt; Led by the acting lieutenant, your sailors hurtle down the boarding bridges and storm the pirate ship, leaving a mangled trail in their wake. The black flag is ripped from the mast, and the pirate's booty is plundered. Unexpectedly, however, your lieutenant then impishly permits the survivors to go free — "Come now, be humble in thy victory! For how dull would the world be without these old pirate salts!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802783</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Pirates are always ready for a skirmish!&lt;/b&gt; Having delayed boarding until they were properly armed and ready, your men fail to make use of their conviction. On seeing the pirate planks fall first, your lieutenant backtracks, urging caution in the face of the oncoming horde!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802784</GUID><Text>Stay put and pick them off</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802786</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You only take a few losses&lt;/b&gt; between reloads, when wild pirates set upon the soldiery with cutlasses and handaxes. Suddenly there is a cry from the pirate ship. The pirate captain has been hit! Clutching her chest, she is borne away below deck on the shoulders of her shipmates. The pirates immediately withdraw so that they may attend to their queen.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802787</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The first round of rifle fire misses,&lt;/b&gt; and there is no time to prepare a second before the horde are on top of your crew, binding the strongest first, and maiming those who resist. When the hurly-burly's over, the pirates prop your bound survivors against each other as they trawl the ship for goodies, before they wish you "fair winds" and depart, cackling with glee.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802785</GUID><Text>Charge anyway!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802788</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your men don't hesitate having come this far.&lt;/b&gt; There is a din as the two packs collide, like rugby players, over the divide between the boats. Blood surges over the wooden boards, as men fall on both sides. Finally, the pirates are driven back, at which point they retract their boarding planks and raise their sails to the breeze, spinning away to prey on victims less chewy.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802789</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your men hesitate a second too long,&lt;/b&gt; and the pirates have made up the distance between the ships. Now they've been allowed on board, they have the upper hand, and are soon on top of your crew, binding them and maiming those who resist. When the hurly-burly's done, the pirates prop your bound survivors against each other as they trawl the ship for goodies, before wishing you "fair winds" and departing, cackling with glee.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802781</GUID><Text>Fire all cannons!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802790</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The pirates are sunk&lt;/b&gt; before they have a chance to do any damage at all!

Even as the horde board, the defenders' minds seem elsewhere, hypnotised perhaps by the tall and angular captain with greying hair and a wizened visage, who stalks the deck juicing your sailors. Once the pirates have taken everything they desire, they leave just as mysteriously as they appeared. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>803029</GUID><Text>The Breakout</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803042</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Unfair imprisonment!&lt;/b&gt; While enjoying some well-deserved shore leave, a local militia seizes a dozen members of your expedition without explanation. They are taken to a fortress that's been hollowed into the sandstone cliffs that dominate the harbour. The charges against your crew prove spurious to say the least, and when a hefty sum is demanded in exchange for their release, the militia's intentions become all too plain.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803031</GUID><Text>Pay the outrageous fine</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803034</GUID><Text>This is preposterous</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803035</GUID><Text>Confirm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803037</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The fine is duly paid.&lt;/b&gt; Of course, your crew boil as the militia counts the payment and divides it up between them, all while flapping without remorse about the noble old art of bribery. Yet your sailors take comfort that they have been allowed to leave safe and sound, and mark the harbour on the map with the noble intention of forewarning other seafarers of the ruse.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803036</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803038</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No fine, no prisoners.&lt;/b&gt; The militia make it clear: your crew members will not be freed unless their ludicrous demands are met.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803032</GUID><Text>Try to break the prisoners out</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803039</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You secure an early release!&lt;/b&gt; Your men return to the ship and wait for nightfall. At the sight of a signal flare, the prisoners anticipate your course of action and place a lit candle by the bars of each window. After careful calibration of the cannons, a second flare goes up signalling the imminent blast. The candles extinguish in acknowledgement before the ship's guns sound. The cliff wall of the fortress crumbles away! Taking their chances, the prisoners launch themselves into the water below, just as your ship passes by. Tales of the daring rescue will be going around for years.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803040</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You make a mess of the fortress — and the poor people inside.&lt;/b&gt; The cannon fire impacts the cliff, but your artillerymen have not taken enough care in their calculations. The fortress walls crumble easily enough, but the occupants of the cells are either killed in the blast, or plunge to their deaths on the rocks below. As your expedition makes a hasty exit, the crew try to come to terms with what they have done.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803033</GUID><Text>Leave without the captive sailors</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803041</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"I think that's the last we shall ever see of them,"&lt;/b&gt; lament the sailors that night, as the anchor is raised and the westerly breeze tears them away from the unforgiving fortress. As they depart, candles appear at the bars of each cell, signifying — in the imagination of your crew at least — a unanimous verdict of reproach. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>800277</GUID><Text>The Ghost Ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800254</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;After weeks of hot weather, supplies of drinking water have become dangerously low.&lt;/b&gt; It therefore seems a minor miracle when a fellow ship appears on the horizon, for surely they have water to share? But as it draws near, the crew are aghast, for there is no sign of life aboard. 'It is a ghost ship, we must flee before it is too late!' they cry.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800255</GUID><Text>Send a diver to check it out</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800258</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The diver does remarkably&lt;/b&gt; to spot the fiends furled in sails, or waiting under barrels to ambush, should your men have boarded. Your ship draws alongside the vessel as if to pass, but then unleashes enough cannon-fire to drown it. The crew are elated, believing they have done the oceans a great service.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800256</GUID><Text>Heathen superstition! Board the ship!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800259</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Heavens shine upon you,&lt;/b&gt; for whatever caused the crew to vacate this ship seems no longer a concern. Better yet, the lord has seen fit to provide the water you seek.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800260</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ship's hold contains an unholy mound&lt;/b&gt; of corpses. 'God hath forsaken these men', says the doctor, 'but how?'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800262</GUID><Text>Have the doctor investigate what happened</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800264</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'We are lucky indeed,&lt;/b&gt; for malaria cannot reach us now.' says the doctor confidently. This swift diagnosis confirms the crew are pleased to load up the drinking water they have been gasping for.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800265</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Touch nothing! Get off the ship,'&lt;/b&gt; frets the doctor, who believes a dreadful plague has taken the crew of this ill-fated vessel. Perhaps drinking water is itself the cause. The crew are miserable time has been wasted, and that their thirst is still not slaked.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800266</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor is inconsolable,&lt;/b&gt; 'it is plague. I lanced a bubo, and it ruptured suddenly upon my person!' That the water be contaminated is misery enough, but to have to abandon the good doctor is a disaster! Your expedition drifts glumly on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800263</GUID><Text>Leave the ship immediately</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800267</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No relief at escaping the grotesque mound of corpses,&lt;/b&gt; can compensate the terrible thirst of your crew. There are murmurings that no such expedition can succeed if 'gift horses always be looked in the mouth.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800261</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew are so faithless,&lt;/b&gt; that every creaking plank aboard the ghostly ship raises a whimper. So when a banshee howl erupts from below deck, every sailor runs for their life. One poor soul trips in a coil of rigging and cracks their head upon an iron capstan. The death exposes all the more the crew's foolishness.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800257</GUID><Text>Leave and hope to find an island with drinking water soon</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800268</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No relief at escaping the disturbingly empty ship,&lt;/b&gt; can compensate the terrible thirst of your crew. There are murmurings that no such expedition can succeed if 'gift horses always be looked in the mouth.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800269</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Terrifyingly, the ship takes after yours in pursuit.&lt;/b&gt; Who knows what dread hands operate its multifarious controls!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800270</GUID><Text>Try to outrun the awful vessel!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800272</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your ship manages to escape&lt;/b&gt; the ghoulish clutches of that unwholesome adversary, but have no drinking water, or anything else, to show for the ordeal.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800273</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your ship is not agile enough.&lt;/b&gt; Men pour into the waves from where enemy cannons punch holes. Seemingly contented with this sacrifice, the dread sentience commanding the vessel calls off its dreadful pursuit.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800271</GUID><Text>Turn and face it, whatever it is!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800274</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Pirates! But trickery cannot match the power of a modern seaship!&lt;/b&gt; Summarily demolished, a few of them are left clinging to wreckage. They beg to join your cause - unpaid. Such are the dwindling prospects of piracy in this day! The crew will jibe at them, but secretly all must be elated to have acquired such sea-wisdom for free.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800275</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A pirate nuisance!&lt;/b&gt; Though their scurvy deception gives them advantage, they are like many of their creed, rather jaded. By the time their ship is sunk, it has cost you a few good men. Yet the recovery of precious drinking water in among the flotsam, assuages the grief of your crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800276</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Bloody pirates! A terrible menace even in this day and age!&lt;/b&gt; Your crew are outmanoeuvred, outsmarted, and your ship is reeled-in for boarding. Many are killed in valiant defence of the company, but to no avail. Your vessel is duly ransacked for supplies, before the villains are again on their way.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800537</GUID><Text>The Visitation</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800538</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An undesirable visitor haunts the ship.&lt;/b&gt; Fleeting silhouettes, knocking and screeching sounds. Each morning the ship appears in utter disarray. 'A night fiend,' gulps the hardiest of old crewmen, as he sweeps debris from the deck. As night draws in again, you realise something must be done.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800539</GUID><Text>Listen to your expert</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800543</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Every right to a little joke.&lt;/b&gt; 'These claw marks!' the naturalist feigns horror. 'Is it something terrible?!' asks a fearful sailor. But the naturalist can bite tongue no longer, and succumbs to laughter; 'No! Good heavens. We have a mother and kittens aboard!' The cat family is found in a barrel, which, it is agreed, shall serve as their home for the duration. The crew dote on the little rascals, their presence a great comfort.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800540</GUID><Text>Perform an exorcism</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800544</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Each sailor strides with inner conviction,&lt;/b&gt; as they form a procession of candles behind the smug-looking priest, flooding holy light into every heathen crevice. The priest's ritual is unfaltering, and not only are the crew rid of the night-time menace, but now believe it is god's plan the expedition will succeed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800545</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew has its sceptics,&lt;/b&gt; even though the exorcism seems at first to have worked. Two days later a sailor cries, 'It had glowing yellow eyes!' upon having sighted the demon near the hold. The unholy thing must be caught.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800546</GUID><Text>Bait the thing with food</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800547</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is nothing so savage.&lt;/b&gt; All are concealed around the strip of meat, expecting the worst. But what descends from the rafters of the hold, silent and gentle winged, is a luminous white owl. It is an ambiguous omen, according to those that know, but the sailors are content to keep it aboard.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800548</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Whatever it is, it is far too clever.&lt;/b&gt; It avoids the bait, but continues its night raids. Rumour this is an offended Klabautermann are substantiated by several separate accounts. Little voices overheard, brief sightings, even the discovery of a miniature table and chair. Some can live with the impish nuisance, but many will jump ship at the next port..</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800549</GUID><Text>Build a trap to catch the thing</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800550</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The cage-trap is well-made,&lt;/b&gt; and daybreak reveals an unlikely specimen encaged. 'A sort of badger?' is the first analysis, which in actuality, is fairly far from the mark. The compendium of animalia in the ship's library reveals it a 'northern raccoon', also remarking that is 'quite edible.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800551</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The snapping trap is weak and flimsy.&lt;/b&gt; The crew are excited by a sharp sound, but rush to the scene, only to find the bait gone, and the trap in disrepair. A piece of bright red felt caught in the spring explains all. 'Klabautermann!' they despair, for it is a terrible omen to offend a sea goblin as they have done.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800552</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew don't have much belief,&lt;/b&gt; and the priest makes a hash of the exorcism. If anything, his fragmented delivery only agitates the creature. The next night, a sailor is adamant he has sighted something 'irrefutably demonic.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800554</GUID><Text>Gather arms and confront it</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800557</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Rather excessive.&lt;/b&gt; The soldiery tense as strange noises draw near. Fingers itch upon triggers. The moment demon wings flap into view, the night is lit up with powder. Finally the smoke subsides, and the mangled thing is revealed to be nothing more than a bat. Troops thunder heavily about the ship, before discovering the rest of the hog-nosed critters in the hold. Everyone is left feeling utterly stupid.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800558</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your lily-livered cowards quiver like jelly!&lt;/b&gt; Fear chokes them as they spin wildly about looking for something to shoot that they can't see. Two are so panicked they bump together, causing the other to suddenly fire. Shot hits an angelic young sailor, killing instantly. The night terror is gone, but has taken for payment the most undeserving of souls.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800555</GUID><Text>Sate the demon with a sacrificial offering</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800559</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A man's finger for a stowaway weasel!&lt;/b&gt; In good faith, a pious sailor volunteers the pinkie of his right hand as a votive offering. But at the smell of blood, it is a slinky little mustelid that appears. With the weasel caught and caged, the night terror is over, but the sailors will not forgive or forget the loss of a good man's finger.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800560</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Sacrilege!&lt;/b&gt; A prohibited tome is consulted, the vile solicitations of its pages consuming the crew! Unspeakable acts are performed upon a man, so that the demon can be assuaged. Yet still the menace remains, and worse, the crew's sacrificial victim bleeds out from his injuries.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800556</GUID><Text>Don't anger the creature further</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800561</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The practical joke is ruined.&lt;/b&gt; The bored sailors bemoan the pathetic response to their little entertainment. That the senior officers have been duped by an obvious ruse, makes all severely doubt their fitness to lead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800553</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The faithless crew never take any part of the exorcism seriously.&lt;/b&gt; 'What's the point of hocus-pocus when its but greedy sailors stealing?!' yells one man. Accusations fly between conspiracy theorists, until a violent brawl breaks out. At the next mooring, the injured parties desert your godless expedition.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800541</GUID><Text>Find the culprit</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800563</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sharp-nosed hunters pick up a scent.&lt;/b&gt; Pungent droppings demarcate a perimeter, in the centre of which is a crate with a hole. A sailor reaches his arm bravely in. There is a brief struggle, and a whine like the ones at night, before the troublemaker is pulled out. It is a common garden fox. The cunning little creature becomes the crew's talisman for the remainder of the expedition.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800564</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Hunters find tracks, but can't say what made them.&lt;/b&gt; The marks are indeed strange - disturbing almost. Claw marks that go deep in the decking, as if the unspeakable thing that made them was in some frenzy.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800566</GUID><Text>Smoke it out of hiding</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800569</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Reassuringly human coughing comes from within.&lt;/b&gt; It turns out you have a stowaway - a young girl wishing to escape a life of hardship. She is spirited., and the crew take to her quickly. She is given work to do, and food to eat. All believe she shall prove their good luck charm.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800567</GUID><Text>Build a trap to catch whatever it is</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800570</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Knowing its habits helps.&lt;/b&gt; The box is made to measure, and along with its clever latch, is placed where the fiend seems most often to be. The box is found in the morning, with a gigantic rat inside it. The trap appears to have killed it, and that is the end of the matter.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800571</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ramshackle trap box is in bits the next morning.&lt;/b&gt; While to some they appear benign, the claw marks appear more frequently. Once a man wakes with his cheeks gouged. Some are so perturbed by the night demon, that they slink off the ship at the next available harbour.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800568</GUID><Text>Pray together against the spirit</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800572</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A feeling of calm descends upon the crew.&lt;/b&gt; The prayer seems to fill the spiritual void in the sailor's breasts. Approaching the world with a new perspective means even if the unexplained episodes at night persist, they pay it no mind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800573</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The communal prayer is broken by more wild shrieking.&lt;/b&gt; It matters not that, apart from vanishing supplies, the mischievous spirit seems fairly harmless. The crew are deeply troubled, and worry their souls are lost.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800565</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hunters stumble guilelessly into its trap.&lt;/b&gt; The night is unfeasibly pitch, and the hunters' lamps extinguish. Who knows why, without a breath of wind? A scratching draws near. Then a commotion... and screaming, followed by silence. Just like that, the fiend has gone forever, returning to the air whence it came. Three men lie dead in their own blood. Their livers have been removed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800542</GUID><Text>Ignore the menace</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800574</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The menace is very persistent.&lt;/b&gt; Restless nights, devoured food, and stolen supplies shall go unexplained and unresolved for the remainder of the expedition. The crew are at their wit's end.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800972</GUID><Text>Baptism of Fire</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800973</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Everything points towards the fiery gate.&lt;/b&gt; It appears like a hallucination, an ancient stone doorway suffused with blue flame set into the rock face. Perhaps a long lost people constructed it, as a shortcut through the high ridge dividing the region. Your men consider it an auspicious sign, and would like to enter it, but perhaps it would be safer to take the long way through the dense jungle.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800974</GUID><Text>Have the scientist inspect the gate</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800975</GUID><Text>Have faith and leap through the flames</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800976</GUID><Text>Wrap up in something before leaping through</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800977</GUID><Text>Cut through the jungle instead</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800978</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The scientist banishes the illusion.&lt;/b&gt; "The fire that you perceive around the gate is simply an agglomeration of azure glow-worms." Laughter becomes delight, as the party take the pulsing creatures in hand. Indeed, they are of great help in navigating the dark tunnel to the far side of the ridge, saving you days of trekking.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800979</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;If anything the flames are cool&lt;/b&gt;, like bundles of ribbons brushing the skin. This gate is, without question, an earthly manifestation of the divine, for not far along the tunnel, the light breaks in once more, and your party arrive on the far side of the ridge, spiritually tranquil, and having saved days of trekking.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800980</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Some of the crew remain doubtful.&lt;/b&gt; Drawing a little closer to the gate, they are surprised to feel no heat coming from the fire. One leap of faith and they would be through! Still, they hesitate, for a perfect human skeleton lies just the other side of the threshold.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800981</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Alas! Fire and brimstone!&lt;/b&gt; Some of the crew seem entranced by the glowing entrance. The temperatures are volcanic, but the diabolic procession of fanatics are numb to the pain. The others watch horrified, as fabric, skin and flesh renders before their eyes. It makes the long way round seem a miracle of mercy. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>800982</GUID><Text>Try to determine how the person died</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800983</GUID><Text>Order them to charge through!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800984</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor forms a decent hypothesis&lt;/b&gt;, and the crew are convinced. "Even from afar, I can see the bones are in poor condition; not burned, but malnourished." Anxious not to end up the same way, the crew take a gamble, and are astonished to discover that leaping through the gate does them no harm. They follow the tunnel to the other side of the ridge. "I wonder if it was those frogs we licked..." the doctor mumbles.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800985</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.&lt;/b&gt; Your doctor makes several sweeping assumptions, finally concluding, "exhaustion, I'm quite certain. That they died at this particular place is only a coincidence." As the first volunteer crosses the threshold, flames grasp his ankles, then shoot rapidly up and over his body. He drops upon the stone floor, taking his place beside the last poor fool. Horrified, your expedition must go the long way round. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>800986</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Ouch!"&lt;/b&gt; The men yelp, rolling in the stone passageway beyond, until they are sure they are no longer aflame. With the strange gate behind them, your brave soldiers compare their ugly burns as they march through the tunnel to the far side of the ridge.  </Text></Text><Text><GUID>800987</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Cowards!"&lt;/b&gt; Your men lack the discipline to follow a simple order! You will have to find another way.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800988</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They make it.&lt;/b&gt; Rolled-up like carpets, they skip over the strange and fiery threshold. As they wend their way through the passage to the other side of the ridge, their worst complaint is the overwhelmingly sweet pong of sweat that is sure to follow them for the rest of the journey. Still, all remain curious as to what that gate really was.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800989</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"That he died like a sausage?!&lt;/b&gt; What else can I tell his family!?" Either way, your volunteer leapt through the fire and paid with his life. Who knows — perhaps dousing his mantlecoat in a protective layer of paraffin was a mistake! Your expedition will have to trudge the miserable way round.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800990</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew have no regrets&lt;/b&gt; in plotting what they perceive to be a safer, more rational course. Sweaty jungles are the devil they know, snakes and spiders notwithstanding. They make good time, and soon find a shallow incline that leads them up and over to the far side of the ridge. Still, many are curious to know what sorcery was governing the gate they saw. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>800991</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The jungle thins out to a precipice,&lt;/b&gt; which seems to form part of the ridge you are trying to cross. A long and shoddy-looking bridge stretches to the other side, if you want to risk it, or else you could attempt to take an even larger detour. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>800992</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There is no way through,&lt;/b&gt; thanks to your shambolic map reading, as the jungle grows thicker and danker. The group tire, having many disagreements, and separate into factions. The sensible ones stick together, and decide the only realistic option is to backtrack for several weeks. The rest will die among the roots and ferns.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800993</GUID><Text>Take the bridge</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800994</GUID><Text>Circumnavigate the ridge</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800995</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Inspection shows it to be in passable condition.&lt;/b&gt; There are a few nerve-wracking moments during the crossing, as the wind whips up and the rickety bridge begins to sway. In any case, all are rather pleased to reach the other side, from which they succeed in reaching the far side of the ridge.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800996</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Only a fool would ever set foot on it!&lt;/b&gt; Of course, it's nothing if not dramatic as the bridge cables twang, and one after the other, your men pile into the gorge. The craftsmen who had been so very confident in the deathtrap structure's safety choose hang back in shame, as the expedition sorrowfully wends the long way round the ridge.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800997</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is a long trek&lt;/b&gt;, yet one that could have been so much longer were it not for some sound map reading and compass work. The vegetation is thick and stubborn. Your expedition hacks their way through with irritation, marking yet another hiccup for the expedition log book.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800998</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Imbecile orienteers!&lt;/b&gt; There's no way to cross this river valley for a hundred miles! You've covered half that distance before you realise, but having wasted a lot of time and provisions, your men may as well see this major boo-boo through. It takes almost three weeks of struggle before your expedition is back on track. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802269</GUID><Text>Song Of The Sea</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802270</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The lookout is sure of himself: he has sighted a mermaid.&lt;/b&gt; In the hot noon sun, sailors suspend their duties and rush to inspect the mirrory waters for a sign of the creature. Lo! There is something — a glimmer of silver tail, and a sweet yet melancholy melody that follows behind it. Surely it's a mermaid's song!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802272</GUID><Text>Ask for expert opinion</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802274</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Something just as rare, and no less magical!" chuckles your zoologist,&lt;/b&gt; who proceeds to dive after the creature, resurfacing a short while later. "Poor little soul seems to have been separated from its mother," your zoologist splutters, clutching a juvenile specimen of an obscure sea-dwelling species. "Would you chaps kindly run her a bath? I think we'd better take her with us." From now on, whenever your crew feel sad, they can stop by the creature's tub and enjoy its special warblings.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802275</GUID><Text>Answer the mermaid's call with a sailor's chant</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802276</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Not one, but a dozen strange sea creatures answer the spirited shanty,&lt;/b&gt; swimming and leaping joyfully alongside your vessel. Since they seem like no creature you've ever seen, it might be an opportunity to catch a specimen for the benefit of natural science...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802277</GUID><Text>Try to catch one alive</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802278</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A fine catch!&lt;/b&gt; Taking care not to hurt the beautiful creature, your fishermen haul the great net from the water, and let her slop into a tub they've prepared in the hold. The crew take to calling her "Mermaid". Though she has been separated from her pod, she seems to enjoy being doted upon, and will certainly be kept well fed. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802279</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The men aren't used to catching fish alive.&lt;/b&gt; They trap one of the creatures alright, but hoist the net so roughly it provokes the creature to struggle. It contorts desperately, striping its flippers a glistening red, before finally wrenching itself free. Reunited, the 'mermaids' flee to the depths, and your sailors are left songless but for the howl of the winds.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802280</GUID><Text>Leave the poor creatures be</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802281</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An otherworldly duet.&lt;/b&gt; The creatures dance over the waves, as your sailors' song reprises, "I dreamed a dream the other night/Lowlands, lowlands away, my John/My love she came all dressed in white/My lowlands away". There is no greater source of pride for a sailor than having made peace with the ocean.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802282</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The mermaid vanishes.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors drawl a patriotic war ballad they are fond of, but it has a threatening air, and the siren does not deign to answer. Blue in the face from trying, the sailors mourn the ill omen of the mermaid's disappearance, permitting themselves no more thoughts of she and her sisters, or their undersea kingdom.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802283</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;When the mermaid disappears, a sailor dives in after her!&lt;/b&gt; Your irreverent sailors pick a lewd shanty to sing. Angry this moment of innocence is being spoiled, the impassioned young man tosses himself into sea to pursue the fleeting creature. He is not much of a swimmer.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802284</GUID><Text>Save the poor boy!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802285</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;He's coughed up a lot of water, but he'll live.&lt;/b&gt; The navigators scream for someone to jump in after him, to give them time to bring the ship about. The boy is already sinking by the time his comrade catches up with him, but he's hauled to the surface where the ship is now waiting. When he finally comes to, the boy describes how beautiful the mermaid was, and how invitingly her tail swished. The sailors are so jealous of the boy, they instantly regret having bothered to save him. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802286</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Pursuing in the ship is a mistake.&lt;/b&gt; You lose sight of the boy, until someone realises he must have slipped underneath the keel. Divers emerge with the pale dead boy in their arms. The stories of mermaids are true — but that's not the only hard lesson your crew have learned this day.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802287</GUID><Text>Let the fool go if that's what he wants</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802288</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The smitten boy drowns.&lt;/b&gt; He paddles himself to exhaustion, driven on by the hope of something better. Whatever that noble feeling was, you're fairly certain it won't be the emotion written on his face as he asphyxiates. His letters later show a preexisting disillusionment with life aboard the ship, describing a "culture of bullying most uncivil."   </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802289</GUID><Text>Convince the sailors to ignore the creature</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802290</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Duty trumps distraction.&lt;/b&gt; Awoken by the earnest plea of the presiding officer, the sailors return immediately to their posts. The officer makes the case that it "can be a great source of pride to have not given in to temptation," and that "this is our way of life at sea." Plugging their ears with wax like the heroes of an ancient tale, the men now seem more concentrated than ever on overcoming the far greater challenges ahead. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802291</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Curiosity gets the better of your crew.&lt;/b&gt; If the fable is true, it would be against all superstition to ignore it. The men ignore the squawked orders of their superiors and begin muttering among themselves about how best to catch the mermaid's attention. When one grabs hold of the wheel to change course, it is clear things have got out of hand. The bo'sun, finding this challenge to authority thoroughly unacceptable, brandishes the whip.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802293</GUID><Text>Have the sailors flogged</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802294</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors grumble back to their posts.&lt;/b&gt; Resorting to such primitive naval discipline has left a bit of a bad atmosphere, but you doubt it will last forever. Besides, the bos'un only gave them a very gentle bruising — anything more than that is frowned upon these days. At least those silly thoughts of mermaids have been well and truly banished.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802295</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What you have done is illegal,&lt;/b&gt; and the crew have no difficulty making their displeasure known. After the bo'sun has beaten a man's back to a pulp, the crew gather on the top deck, where the cries of the mermaid can still be heard, although it sounds like weeping now. "That act was outlawed a half century ago. We hereby notify you of our forthcoming testimony against the bo'sun in a court of law — that is, if we ever manage to return." Morale aboard stoops to a new low. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802296</GUID><Text>Drop the issue and let them be</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802297</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Discipline aboard this ship is lax.&lt;/b&gt; Convinced that their misconduct will go unpunished, the sailors take to negotiating, and even outright ignoring the tedious instructions of the officers. The use of "mermaid" as a keyword becomes synonymous with this rebellious undercurrent, which is sure to blight the rest of the voyage.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802381</GUID><Text>Call Of The Devil</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802382</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Can it be the voice of a child this deep in the jungle?&lt;/b&gt; The expedition has taken a several-day sojourn inland, looking for citrus to save them from scurvy. Taking shelter during a particularly heavy cloudburst, they are sure they can hear children's voices through the pitter-patter of rain. Your men strain to see where it may be coming from. "It is Lucifer, of cloven hoof, leading us astray!" whispers the priest, "Pay him no heed!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802383</GUID><Text>Let your zoologist speak</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802386</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Hush you insufferable fool, it is a marvellous species of talking bird!"&lt;/b&gt; exclaims the zoologist. Following a trail of excrement on the rainforest floor, the zoologist soon finds a colourful feather. "Raaawwwk!" splutters something in the trees above. The expedition crane up their necks to find the most colourful avian peering sidelong down at them. The specimen is duly captured for the benefit of the natural sciences.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802384</GUID><Text>Ignore the devil voices</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802387</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors close their minds to the voices.&lt;/b&gt; With the stubbornness of true believers, your crew convince themselves it is devil speak, repeating "I renounce him, his demons and his works!" Their faith is affirmed when the rain stops, and the voices desist. Later that day, they stumble across Eden; a thicket of Camucamu fruit trees. "Very tart fruits indeed," says the doctor, "precisely what we've been wanting."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802388</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The voices are too persistent for them to ignore.&lt;/b&gt; "I must know what they are!" one man cries, and the priest cannot seem to dissuade him or others from venturing from the shelter to seek them out. The further they go from the camp, the clearer the child-like chatter becomes. It feels inevitable something terrible is going to happen.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802389</GUID><Text>At least let the priest go ahead</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802391</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The priest's incantations subdue the Devil.&lt;/b&gt; The priest swats his flickering torch in front of the party, bellowing incessantly "God is my salvation, the Lord be my sword and shield!", his mouth brimming with rainwater, until someone shakes him by the shoulder. He startles, but his comrade reassures him. "The voices have ceased! You have saved us — saved us from temptation!"  </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802392</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The devil noise drowns out the priest's prayer.&lt;/b&gt; As he anoints each sailor hastily with holy water, a voice identical to his screeches "Get away devil!", and raucous laughter erupts from the forest all around. Men and women run for dear life, only for the jungle to swallow them up. The ship feels very empty on the onward journey. "Led to the underworld," the captain prods the disgraced priest in the chest, "by the agents of Lucifer!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802390</GUID><Text>Run for the ocean</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802393</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The voices are gone, but the scurvy is terrible.&lt;/b&gt; Scarpering from the jungle, the crew leave all their supplies behind. In addition, the expedition has not found the vitamin-rich fruit it so badly needed. It will be several weeks before new land is sighted, and the crew's teeth and hair are already falling out.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802385</GUID><Text>Find a more rational explanation</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802394</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's not children they've heard, but birds!&lt;/b&gt; The hunters among the crew know it right away, signalling to the others to be quiet as they scan the trees for the cacophonous culprits. Before too long, one of the brightly-coloured beauties makes itself known. The hunters manage to capture it, and bring the little marvel back on board for the benefit of the natural sciences.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802395</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Fear incites a rash decision.&lt;/b&gt; The majority tremble in silence, as the eerie voice draws ever nearer, except for one cocksure officer who jabs his pistol every which way, looking for something to shoot. Seeing movement among the trees he fires, only to see his bullet graze the shoulder of an indigenous girl, perhaps five or six years old. It is likely she has never come across the white devil before, and she disappears into the trees wailing. She will survive. The officer, however, is clutching his chest — he has had a heart attack, and he dies.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802397</GUID><Text>The Treasure of&lt;br/&gt;Hassan Ben Sahid</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802398</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An old man claims to know the location of a great treasure.&lt;/b&gt; You've stopped over at a sandswept port. A gaggle of officers are enjoying sweet cardamom-infused coffee in the morning sun, when one of the patrons approaches. He is old and blind; his clothes dirty. "I have need of adventurers like yourselves, for the treasure of the pirate Hassan Ben Sahid is here! It is just waiting to be found!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802399</GUID><Text>Believe the old man and follow him</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802401</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;He trusts you, and proffers a crinkled map of the town.&lt;/b&gt; It is annotated with an unusual script. "Take it! I cannot read it," he says, swatting flies from his milky and crusted eyes, "but then, I never could solve it, even when I had my sight!" It turns out the only thing he is absolutely sure of is that the treasure is hidden nearby.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802403</GUID><Text>Try to decode the map</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802405</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;One of the officers makes the map talk.&lt;/b&gt; She is an educated woman — a graduate of a fine old university, who snuck into the navy by shaving her head. "Arabic," she says, "but here it's written from left to right, like a mirror image." It reads: &lt;br/&gt;"Hassan Ben Sahid breathes his last,&lt;br/&gt;Upon you these spoils fairly won,&lt;br/&gt;As I enter that lavish garden,&lt;br/&gt;may your own thirst be quenched."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802407</GUID><Text>Read it spiritually, go to the cemetery</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802409</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The treasure of Hassan Ben Sahid!&lt;/b&gt; The cemetery is modest; just unmarked funeral stones jutting up from the dust. Each is pointing in the same direction. "We need not disturb the dead," your officer says, pointing to a lush grove of date palm, "for our thirst has been quenched!" There, in its centre, is a working noria that might have been running for centuries. "Lower me down," she says. At the bottom of the well is the most extraordinary golden hoard! You go to thank the old blind man, but he has vanished...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802410</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your officers rigidly uphold their beliefs.&lt;/b&gt; The old blind man leads you to the modest cemetery — a square of unmarked funeral stones jutting up from the dust. Each is pointing in the same direction. "We should not disturb the dead," the officers agree. There are simply too many stones to know where to start — and no way of guessing which belonged to Ben Sahid. The crew return to the ship, believing that at least they tried.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802408</GUID><Text>Read it literally and seek out a garden</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802411</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The treasure of Hassan Ben Sahid!&lt;/b&gt; "The map smells sickly sweet with something," says one keen-nosed officer, "dates, perhaps!" After hunting around, the officers come across a lush grove of date palm. "Our thirst is quenched!" they cry, for there in its centre is a working noria, which might have been running for centuries. One of them is lowered down to the bottom of the well, where they find the most extraordinary golden hoard! You go to thank the old blind man, but he has vanished...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802412</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Though pleasant, the search is fruitless.&lt;/b&gt; There are many gardens between the arched babs of the old town, and none any less sweet-scented or busy-with-bees than the last. The crew give up their efforts to find the spot where Ben Sahid's treasure lies buried, instead preferring the less tangible rewards of exploring a new and unfamiliar place.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802406</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No-one can work out what the message says.&lt;/b&gt; "Looks a bit like Arabic?" offers one of the confused officers. The old blind man sighs a bitter sigh, snatches back his map, and departs. As the ship leaves port, rumours spread of the gold, sapphires and rubies that have been passed up. The crew can't help but feel disappointed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802404</GUID><Text>Try to read the map</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802413</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A treasure cache!&lt;/b&gt; Matching the landmarks of the city to the crude objects depicted on the faded map, one thing in particular sticks out. "An old fort!" a smart young officer exclaims. The blind man follows the eager beagles in amusement, as they set off at a giddy clip. He knows the fort cannot be where Ben Sahid's treasure is buried, since it belonged to a great enemy of his who came from the far north. Nevertheless, it is full of unclaimed riches!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802414</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The map appears worthless without the annotations.&lt;/b&gt; "We could have just remained in that wonderful old square under that marvellous arched gate, and sipped our coffee on this beautiful sunny day. Instead, we've sweat our braces off on this childish treasure hunt! We've seen the whole city, and yet we've seen absolutely nothing at all!" So much for relaxing shore leave...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802402</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The old man leads you into a trap!&lt;/b&gt; He chatters amiably all the way to a hammam — a steam bath — where he insists a descendant of Ben Sahid now works. Before they can realise how misplaced their trust in him was, your officers, naked and relieved of their weapons, are surrounded by a gang asking for payment.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802415</GUID><Text>Fight your way out</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802417</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's a bit of a wrestling match.&lt;/b&gt; "How do you like that eh, sirrah!" blares your punchiest officer, emerging from the fight the victor, his adversary left gasping and bloody-nosed on the marble floor. "What do you think you're doing!" rages the proprietor of these fabulously frescoed baths, "this is a place of peace you have defiled!" So much for relaxing shore leave...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802418</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An officer drowns in a sweat-filled bath.&lt;/b&gt; Punches are thrown in every direction, and no-one sees him hit his head. The thugs hold up their hands, "we never thought it would come to this," they say, when it's discovered he is dead. There is a sombre mood as he's carried back aboard ship, and the others have to explain how he came to such a bizarre end.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802416</GUID><Text>Give them what they want</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802419</GUID><Text>They watch as your embarrassed crew empty their pockets</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802420</GUID><Text>Accept</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802422</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You trade various goods in return for safe passage.&lt;/b&gt; Not so much a trade as blackmail, your sailors feel the shame of ridicule as their clothes are returned. What kind of rational being believes in the existence of Ben Sahid's treasure, and permits a blind man to lead them to it!?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802421</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802423</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your men offer far too little,&lt;/b&gt; so the bathhouse thugs help themselves to it all anyway. Their ringleader, the old man who led your treasure-seeking officers here, turns out not to be blind at all. He gives your officers something rather less pleasant than a massage until they agree to write a note ordering supplies be released from the ship's hold. Once the exchange has been made, your shame-faced officers are finally allowed to go free.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802400</GUID><Text>Decline the promise of riches</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802424</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Fantasies of pirate treasure belong to another century.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew ignores the blind man, who becomes rather angry and beats the backs of the officers with his fists. The officers pity him, and do not try to retaliate. Eventually he hobbles off, muttering to himself. As the ship leaves port, rumours spread of the gold, sapphires and rubies that have been passed up. The crew can't help but feel disappointed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802426</GUID><Text>Too Good To Be True?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802427</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A delicious-looking banquet, with no-one around to eat it!&lt;/b&gt; Rising smoke encourages the crew to put to shore, but upon their arrival, they find the hamlet of conical stone huts to be deserted. Nevertheless, after months on jerky and biscuits, the sight of the fresh fish, cassava, and bananas wrapped in banana leaves that have been left out has the crew salivating! "It's too good to be true!" a sage old sailor warns.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802428</GUID><Text>Heed the old sailor's warning</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802431</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The expedition have absolute faith in his words.&lt;/b&gt; "We may yet be allowed to eat, if we appease the spirit of this fair glen," the old sailor croons, gesturing towards a stone marked with white chalk that appears to have fallen on its side. The crew have absolute faith in his words. "That's what mother always told me about fairy circles, and I never knew her to be wrong..."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802434</GUID><Text>Study the chalk spirit on the stone</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802437</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew study the chalk symbol with due reverence.&lt;/b&gt; It has three points like an arrowhead, and the smiling face of a deity at its centre. The crew interpret the slight angle of this triangle as a sign, since it points roughly towards a distant and cloud-wreathed peak. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802439</GUID><Text>Let your anthropologist piece the clues together</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802442</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your men are soon enjoying every hospitality.&lt;/b&gt; "It is a three-pointed zemi," the anthropologist says excitedly. "The inhabitants of this village have departed to the mountain yonder, to thank the spirit for a plentiful harvest." Your men put away their weapons, and sit cross-legged by the stone awaiting their return. The locals are surprised and afraid to have foreign visitors, but sensing only good intentions, they invite you to their hearty feast. The chief enjoys your company greatly, and insists you take an amulet and some bananas as a parting gift.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802440</GUID><Text>Follow the arrow towards the mountain</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802443</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your men are soon enjoying every hospitality.&lt;/b&gt; You're following the trail when your sharp-eyed scout remarks "The villagers are returning from the mountain! They're armed with nothing but palm leaves!". You await them in the open, making sure to keep any weapons out of sight. The locals are surprised, and afraid to have visitors, but as this is an auspicious day, they invite you to a hearty feast. The chief enjoys the company of your knowledgeable woodsmen greatly, and insists you take an amulet and some bananas as a parting gift.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802444</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew find some bananas at least.&lt;/b&gt; You're following the trail when your scout says in agitation, "The villagers return from the mountain! They're carrying fearsome weapons!". Heeding the scout's worries, the crew detour through a banana grove, where they stock up on fruit and return to the ship. Later, upon hearing the scout's description of the weapons, some crew members begin to wonder if they might not just have been the branches of a royal palm...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802441</GUID><Text>Leave while you still can</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802445</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The expedition party are content to gather their own food.&lt;/b&gt; Leaving the strange village and its untouched banquet behind, the crew soon encounter a banana grove. "A fitting reward for our having left the spirits of that village undisturbed," the old sailor says with a satisfied air, evidently in favour of the rather pious restraint your people have shown in this place.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802438</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"It's just a child's drawing,"&lt;/b&gt; is the cynical analysis offered by the ship's quartermaster, which no-one else has sufficient conviction to debate. "And what's it got to do with whether we eat that food or not?" Spiritual nourishment seems to be the last thing on the minds of your crew...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802435</GUID><Text>Lift the ritual stone back up</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802446</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Back in its correct position,&lt;/b&gt; the chalk symbol looks like an arrow pointing towards a distant mountain. Showing their fine physical condition, your men lift the stone on a count of three. It must weigh a ton, but they still make short work of it. The symbol is a three-pointed star, with a face in its midst, which seems to the trackers to suggest the direction in which the villagers must have departed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802447</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The statue won't budge.&lt;/b&gt; As many men whose hands can fit around the slab attempt to lift it, but to no avail. "And what's it got to do with whether we eat that food or not?" pipes up one of your scrawny soldiers. Spiritual nourishment seems to be the last thing on the minds of your crew...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802436</GUID><Text>Leave while you still can</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802451</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The expedition party are content to gather their own food.&lt;/b&gt; Leaving the strange village and its untouched banquet behind, the crew soon encounter a banana grove.

Before anyone can take a bite however, &lt;b&gt;the villagers reappear looking rather cheesed off.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802452</GUID><Text>Food fight!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802454</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A greedy, but profitable raid.&lt;/b&gt; Neither side wants to die for a picnic, so they come at each other with whatever they can find; palm branches, rocks, even handfuls of dirt. Needless to say, the scuffle is a very odd spectacle indeed, but eventually results in the villagers fleeing into the forest. The feast, meanwhile, has been almost entirely trampled and smeared into the raffia matting on which it had been laid out — but the crew do manage to pillage a few handfuls of bananas that they found in a store hut.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802455</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Too awful to be true.&lt;/b&gt; As the villagers rush forwards, your men fire wildly, only to realise the tribe are unarmed, and intent only on recovering their food. One of them is hit — a woman. There is nothing your medics can do for her. The sense of shame is only compounded upon returning to the ship, when a group of your men are found to have stolen supplies belonging to the villagers, in spite of everything. Your expedition can barely look one another in the eye.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802453</GUID><Text>Try to apologise</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802456</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your people are very diplomatic.&lt;/b&gt; Immediately stepping away from the feast, they raise their hands above their heads and offer a few reassuring words that no harm was meant. The villagers lower their weapons. Though they seem disgruntled at your invasion of their home and ritual, their chief offers you a generous quantity of bananas to wish you peacefully on your way.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802457</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your expedition leaves safe, but hungry.&lt;/b&gt; The villagers stare, silent and disapproving, as your men raise their hands slowly and back away. As the expedition boards the ship, the captain raises a spyglass to the village, high up in the lush green valley. He can see the villagers still watching, waiting, until they are sure the thieves are gone.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802458</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your expedition leaves both hungry, and several men lighter. &lt;/b&gt; Not only have your men desecrated the feast in honour of the spirit of cassava, but they remain unapologetic, poking and prodding the different dishes as if the villagers weren't even there. When one man takes a carved ritual spoon and starts digging in, smiling as he does so, he seems surprised when a villager shoots him. A brief exchange of gunfire follows, before your men flee to avoid taking further losses.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802433</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your band of fools mock the old sailor.&lt;/b&gt; "Old wives' tales!" they guffaw, savaging the feast like locusts, stuffing their mouths with a fervour that would be unthinkable back home. But when one of them suddenly turns pale, the realisation dawns on the others — the food has been poisoned! Who did this? And why!? Your crew survive, but the poisoning is very serious, and requires weeks of recuperation before they are ready to depart this cursed place.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802429</GUID><Text>Scan about for danger</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802461</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A watchful lookout spots the enemy before they attack.&lt;/b&gt; It seems the indigenous people who built these huts were dispossessed of them long ago, and that they now serve as a refuge for pirates and brigands. Forewarned is forearmed, and the crew stage a small ambush of their own. You bait the curs out before overpowering them, taking all the food and supplies they have.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802462</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The command to go ahead and eat is given in error.&lt;/b&gt; The lookout has barely given the all clear when she spots the inhabitants of the village rushing in from all sides.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802463</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The savage bandits find the expedition before it can find them.&lt;/b&gt; It seems the indigenous people who built these huts were dispossessed of them long ago, and that they now serve as a refuge for scoundrels. They whoop and holler from the trees and descend upon a few valiant defenders, as the rest of the expedition turns to flee for the ship. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802430</GUID><Text>Grab the food and run</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802468</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's a trap, of course.&lt;/b&gt; As soon as one of the sailors touches the cassava, a hooting resonates around the village. It seems the indigenous people who built these huts were dispossessed of them long ago, and that they now serve as a refuge for pirates and brigands. As soon as there is gunfire, your sailors scatter in a panic and flee to the ship, empty-handed and badly wounded.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802546</GUID><Text>Apostasy</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802547</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew need some common ground.&lt;/b&gt; It is a fact that your crew were recruited regardless of their origins or beliefs, and your officers now wonder if this was a mistake. After weeks of lasting rainstorms, the more devout sailors raise their voice: this constant punishment is testimony to His obvious displeasure at the heresy aboard. Something is needed to bring the believers and apostates together, before things get out of hand.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802550</GUID><Text>Consult the Norse Sagas</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802556</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Old Norse has much wisdom to share.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“Men brave and generous live the best lives, seldom will they sorrow; then there are fools, afraid of everything, who grumble instead of giving.”&lt;br/&gt;The Sæmundar Edda serves as a gentle reminder to your sailors that their grievances are shallow and foolish.

"Faithless lot! We do not do this for greed as you so plainly do!" Needless to say, the tensions that a few careful words might so easily have relieved, now threaten to sabotage your expedition.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803274</GUID><Text>The Haunted Castle</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803275</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"A-Anyone home...?"&lt;/b&gt; Seeking refuge from a thunderstorm, your people dash for the tumbledown castle. A flash of lightning illuminates its stark towers, barred windows and the solemn stone gryphons either side of the gate. As the last of your party crosses the threshold, an iron portcullis drops and clangs shut behind them! Despite their best efforts, your men cannot seem to lift it. The castle and its courtyard appear empty, but there is a sense that someone — or something — has been expecting you.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803276</GUID><Text>Cry out that you come in peace</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803277</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The officer refuses to give in to his fear,&lt;/b&gt; but calls out steadily "We mean no harm! We only seek refuge from the storm!" As if by magic, the castle's great door creaks open. Your men accept the invitation to shelter, but with palpably less enthusiasm than would be customary on a night such as this. Inside, a once-opulent dining hall greets them, its few flickering candles burned down to a nub. But the attention of the crew is frozen upon the head of the long table, where &lt;b&gt;a vaporous woman appears to be hovering several feet in the air!&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803278</GUID><Text>Refuse to believe it is real</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803301</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"It must be a trick,&lt;/b&gt; for it most certainly is not real!" says a young woman, who rushes forward, hand raised towards the figure. Just as she is about to touch it, it vanishes. "There's a pane of glass here... a mirror!" she exclaims. "Impressive, isn't it!" A diminutive and smartly-dressed man emerges from the shadows, hands aloft, "I'm Jean-Eugène Poivre, and this is my latest invention!" Relief turns to wonder as they marvel at the life-like mannequin he's created for the illusion. "Permit me to make it up to you!" he beams, flipping a switch which fills the hall with electric light. "Geoffery," he calls up to the rafters, "inform the cooks we have guests tonight!" </Text></Text><Text><GUID>803302</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Disbelieve your eyes...!"&lt;/b&gt; The unconvincing advice only serves to startle the crew even further. The moment one of the crew plucks up the courage to take a step forward, the apparition abruptly vanishes. "What manner of horror is this that we have just witnessed? I will not stay here a moment longer!" he says. Finding the portcullis in the courtyard has mysteriously returned to the raised position, your crew take the chance to make a run for it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803303</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"It-it cannot be...!"&lt;/b&gt; An officer's hand quavers towards the apparition, but the faceless woman mirrors him, pointing her claw-like finger as if to single him out. At this sinister omen, everybody dashes for the entrance, screaming, trampling and shoving one another in their haste to flee. Finding the portcullis in the courtyard has mysteriously returned to the raised position, your spooked crew take the chance to make a run for it, only for the portcullis to suddenly fall. No-one but that marked man is crushed under its weight.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803279</GUID><Text>Shoot at the apparition</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803280</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ghostly dinner guest shatters!&lt;/b&gt; It was just a pane of glass, angled to reflect an old mannequin! "Please!" A dimunitive and smartly-dressed man emerges from the shadows, hands aloft, "I'm Jean-Eugène Poivre, and this is my latest invention!" Relief turns to wonder as they marvel at the life-like mannequin he's created for the illusion. "Permit me to make it up to you!" he beams, flipping a switch that fills the hall with electric light. "Geoffery," he calls up to the rafters, "inform the cooks we have guests tonight!" </Text></Text><Text><GUID>803281</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Horror! The bullet passes through flesh and blood!"&lt;/b&gt; "Patricia...! Patricia!!" wails the illusionist, as he rushes from the wings to be beside the actress — his dying wife. "Oh, lord! Whatever have you done, sirs!" A moment later, she dies in his arms. That your soldiers were duped by a bit of make-up and a costume doesn't say much for their judgement. The expedition leaves the poor man and his tragic theatre set, and departs into the rain, which seems to fall harder and louder than ever before.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803282</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The first mate's tremulous voice returns no answer&lt;/b&gt; but its own echo, somehow distorted and corrupted by the castle walls. Could it be that whatever now inhabits this place, no longer has the power to speak? Or perhaps it is merely biding its time...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803283</GUID><Text>Look for a way out</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803284</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's a way out over the walls!&lt;/b&gt; Strangely, no ladder or stairs are found leading up to the high battlements, but the upper part of the keep appears attached. Through a maze of shadowy rooms and hallways, lit only by the occasional flash, the crew discovers a staircase to the third floor. From there they emerge onto the wall, and descend the dark and lush ivy on its exterior, welcoming the feel of the pouring rain from which they had so recently sought to hide.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803285</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;This castle was clearly designed to keep people in.&lt;/b&gt; Strangely, no ladder or stairs are found leading up to the high battlements, but the upper part of the keep appears attached. After what feels like hours wandering the labyrinthine corridors of the keep, a peculiar door swings open. It appears to lead to a master bedroom. A soft, plaintive song rises from within, where a young woman is found at her mirror. She sits combing her hair, her bridal dress soiled and torn, and her face impossibly pale.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803286</GUID><Text>Refuse to believe she is real</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803287</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Faith steadies the soldier's hand as he approaches the bride,&lt;/b&gt; but then he stops abruptly. "You should see your faces!" cackles a diminutive and smartly-dressed man, emerging from the shadows. Suddenly the room fills with electric light. "I'm Jean-Eugène Poivre, and this little beauty is my proudest invention." He winks and twists the bride's head one-hundred and eighty degrees. The automaton is so lifelike, it chills your men even now. They do not take well to learning the illusionist has been toying with them, and leave early the following morning, still very upset.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803288</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Their faith cannot prepare them for this.&lt;/b&gt; Her head suddenly spins on its axis, her face not young and pale as in the mirror, but shrunken and grey — a thousand-years old! — its empty eye sockets seething with a colony of larvae! The sailors run, rushing through the dark, dark halls, trampling the rickety stairs, and out into the rain. Finding the portcullis raised, they rush for the beyond; a lifetime of insomnia.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803289</GUID><Text>Shoot at the apparition</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803290</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The phantom bride shatters!&lt;/b&gt; It was just a sheet of glass, angled to reflect a mannequin in a hidden alcove! A small man storms in from the shadows. "Who do you think you are, destroying my precious illusion?" he screams. "Have you any idea how much effort — not to mention expense — I'd invested in this pure sheet of glass, and the lifelike skin of the mannequin you've just pierced with your bullets! Get away from this place — away!" Your people trudge out into the rain.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803291</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Horror! The bullet passes through flesh and blood!&lt;/b&gt; "Patricia...! Patricia!!" wails the illusionist, as he rushes from the wings to be beside the actress — his dying wife. "Oh, lord! Whatever have you done, sirs!" A moment later, she dies in his arms. That your soldiers were duped by a bit of make-up and a costume doesn't say much for their judgement. The expedition leaves the poor man and his tragic theatre set, and departs into the rain, which seems to fall harder and louder than ever before.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803292</GUID><Text>Try again to force the gates</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803293</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Success!&lt;/b&gt; Unable to resist the sailors' immense strength, the portcullis raises just the fraction needed to get everyone underneath. It takes good teamwork on the far side to get the last stragglers under, and the crew emerge shelterless, but free of this nightmarish place. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>803294</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's useless.&lt;/b&gt; Everyone tries their best, but they simply don't have the strength. Two men strain their shoulders, but still the portcullis cannot be raised an inch. Someone notices a cable leading from the top of the barbican where the portcullis is held, up to a high window on the keep.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803295</GUID><Text>Try to scale the walls instead</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803296</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Finally free of this nightmare!&lt;/b&gt; The sailors are able to help each other up to the battlements, despite the interior walls of the castle being smooth and featureless — almost as if they've been designed to keep people in... Once they've clambered down the ivy on the other side of the thick walls, your expedition party begins to look for somewhere safe to sleep — if it's not too cold and wet, that is.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803297</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Only the able-bodied make it.&lt;/b&gt; The interior walls of the castle are smooth and featureless — almost as if they've been designed to keep people in...  However, only when the skilled climbers reach the battlements do they realise that there's no easy way to help the rest up. "We'll come back for you in the morning," they say. Returning after a damp and sleepless night, they find the portcullis raised, yet can see no sign of their comrades. A thorough search of the castle is conducted, but the devilish place is found to be completely deserted.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803298</GUID><Text>Shelter in the castle courtyard</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803299</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's a foul night in the rain.&lt;/b&gt; There's minimal shelter from the elements within these smooth and featureless walls, and the rising moan of the gale is unbearable. Finally, at dawn, the storm relents. At about half past the hour of ten, the castle door swings open, and a friendly-faced man emerges from it. "What in blazes!" he laughs, "What are all you fellows doing out here!" He explains that he is the heir to this castle, which he claims survived a siege in 1422, and that the portcullis is a rather sensitive beast these days. Your men are pretty peeved, not to mention a little feverish, at the thought they could have spent the night in a comfortable four-poster bed.   </Text></Text><Text><GUID>803389</GUID><Text>La Isla de los Muertos</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803390</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"They say the isle of the dead is not dead at all; that a bone legion guards its secrets..."&lt;/b&gt; The rock that dominates the island looks like a skull  — at least, if you squint and tilt your head. Marrow-pink stone rises a hundred and fifty feet above the forest, pitted with lofty caves that could be mistaken for a multitude of eyes. The dark scar of a mouth at its base could lead somewhere rewarding, &lt;b&gt;if indeed, you are brave enough to delve....&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803391</GUID><Text>"Those stories you loved as a child — this is your chance to be part of one."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803392</GUID><Text>"People in those stories had the chance to turn back, yet they never did. A spirit of adventure kept them going — and that is something we explorers should have in spades!” &lt;b&gt;Galvanized, the crew agree to enter the caves.&lt;/b&gt; In this underworld, where day lives in permanent exile, lamps are lit but die by turns; suffocated by forces ageless and unseen. Your men hesitate to light them again; &lt;b&gt;"The old light burns the eyes of the deathless,"&lt;/b&gt; a voice whispers, "it will anger them."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803393</GUID><Text>Ask them to trust in the person ahead to find a way forward</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803394</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Their conviction in one another is soon rewarded.&lt;/b&gt; The air thins, and a soft greenish light grows out of the darkness. Before long, a cavern has opened up before them. Fingers of limestone glisten up towards the aperture from which that faint and unnatural light gently falls, shining like a spot lamp upon the &lt;b&gt;large stone sarcophagus that weighs at the cavern's centre, sealed firmly shut.&lt;/b&gt; It is marked with the words "Here lieth Ernesto Barragán, king of skull and bone."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803395</GUID><Text>Force the tomb open</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803396</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The mighty lid topples off revealing a sensational treasure!&lt;/b&gt; Your party have shown remarkable strength, and now delight in having cheated the wretched pirate Barragán and his followers in death. "No rest for the wicked!" the captain chuckles, though the adage may just as well apply to his own crew. "Gather what ye may and let us leave this foetid boneyard behind."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803397</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sarcophagus won't budge,&lt;/b&gt; but your expedition leaves the isle of death with their pride intact. "The unnatural cold was enervating..." one officer is quick to clarify, "...and those who built that tomb in honour of this ancient king of bone clearly meant it to last unto eternity, so determinedly was it sealed."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803398</GUID><Text>Blow it open with a bomb</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803399</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A buccaneer's hoard!&lt;/b&gt; The detonation goes off with a pleasing muffled thud, thanks to the care taken when packing the bomb. "Ha-ha!" the captain rasps with glee, "Pirate kings be damned!" Through the fissure the dynamite cleaves comes a first glimpse of the sarcophagus' sensational gilded interior, and the &lt;b&gt;many riches within!&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803400</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The bomb creates chaos!&lt;/b&gt; Loosely packed, and poorly positioned, the amateurish bomb brings the whole roof down. When the cloud, zinging with debris, finally clears, fallen rock is discovered to have sealed the tomb for all eternity. Though the crew leave empty-handed, the experience will have done them no harm.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803401</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Lack of belief forces your party to retreat.&lt;/b&gt; The chain suddenly stops moving forward, and the echoes of a disagreement at its head filter back. "Snap out of it! Keep moving!" "But sir, I swear, that thing had no eyes! I won't move another step!" Despite their efforts to continue, the feeling your party are trespassing only intensifies, and they depart the dreaded rock, drained and deeply perturbed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803402</GUID><Text>It's only the wind and damp, light the lamps again!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803403</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your party's craft is rewarded,&lt;/b&gt; albeit not with the fountains of gold they had anticipated. The lamps are first cleaned and supplied with new wicks and fuel, before being relit and carefully shielded from the wind. The fractured cavity is exposed — adorning its bone-white walls, a pictoral history of the career of the mighty pirate Barragán, who once made this imposing rock his refuge. Feeling enlightened, the expedition leaves with a spring in its step.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803404</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The smoke and soot force your party to retreat!&lt;/b&gt; While the refuelled lamps now remain lit, an excess of kerosene in the mixture produces dirty clouds that fill the lungs and sting the eyes. All further investigation of the skull's interior comes to an abrupt halt over fears the smoke may have done the expedition's health some permanent damage.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803405</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The expedition party seem all the more doubtful.&lt;/b&gt;"Children's stories? Is that the best we've got? And besides, it's precisely this sort of unchecked curiosity that brought the heroes of those stories so much trouble!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803406</GUID><Text>"Surely the promise of treasure outweighs mere superstition?"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803407</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat rattles off a fine argument. &lt;/b&gt;"Which is more likely? That an army of the dead protects that treasure, or that pirates invented the fable to scare adventurers like us from stealing it?" &lt;b&gt;Galvanized, the crew agree to enter the caves.&lt;/b&gt; In this underworld, where day lives in permanent exile, lamps are lit but die by turns, suffocated by forces ageless and unseen. Your men hesitate to light them again; &lt;b&gt;"The old light burns the eyes of the deathless,"&lt;/b&gt; a voice whispers, "it will anger them."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803408</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your officer's argument is bare bones,&lt;/b&gt; his voice increasing in pitch with the realisation that it falls on deaf ears. In desperation, he lays a hand on the first mate's shoulder, whereupon the debate is resolved with a punch to the face. "I thought he'd never shut up!" someone laughs ― but after this episode, humour is likely to be in short supply.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803409</GUID><Text>"We're going in. You don't have a choice..."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803410</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew pull themselves together and enter the cave —&lt;/b&gt; a bit of a grilling from the expedition's most intimidating officer has done the trick. The cave is dank and stifling. In this underworld, where day lives in permanent exile, lamps are lit but die by turns; suffocated by forces ageless and unseen. Your men hesitate to light them again; &lt;b&gt;"The old light burns the eyes of the deathless,"&lt;/b&gt; a voice whispers, "it will anger them."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803411</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The first mate's threats are weak,&lt;/b&gt; and any punishment would be better than facing an army of skeletons as far as the crew are concerned. "If... if you refuse... you will be whipped, do you hear? I don't like doing it, but I will if I have to!" The crew laugh, "Admit it sir, you don't even want to go into that skull yourself!" With the first mate's authority undermined, confidence in the expedition's leadership reaches a new low.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803412</GUID><Text>Treasures and bone armies?! What nonsense!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803413</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew are sad to have passed up an adventure.&lt;/b&gt; At first it's a relief, of course, not to have to confront a giddy army of bone sailors, whom if tales be true, are holed up within that skull-like rock, perhaps swigging spectral rum and grinding their teeth over the life they spent as flesh and blood. Perhaps. But what would your men know? They were never there.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803415</GUID><Text>Give up. It's clear your crew are no heroes.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803416</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew are sad to have passed up an adventure.&lt;/b&gt; At first it's a relief, of course, not to have to confront a giddy army of bone sailors, whom if tales be true, are holed up within that skull-like rock, perhaps swigging spectral rum and grinding their teeth over the life they spent as flesh and blood.

As the fuse is expended, there seems a longer-than-expected pause... only for the boom to sound all the mightier. "Ha-ha!" the captain rasps with glee, "Pirate kings be damned!" Through the fissure the dynamite cleaves comes a first glimpse of the sarcophagus' sensational gilded interior, and the &lt;b&gt;many riches within!&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800467</GUID><Text>Love Island</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800468</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A matter of the heart.&lt;/b&gt; The crew have been enjoying some island hospitality, but many are now refusing to leave. They have fallen in love with the sons and daughters of the local king. Perhaps he can be convinced to allow them to come with you? You can attempt to come to an arrangement, or else wait for him to consult his copper oracle.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800470</GUID><Text>Offer a wedding gift</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800474</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The king is not only surprised,&lt;/b&gt; but moved to tears by the romantic composers he hears via the gramophone. He insists on a grand banquet to celebrate the union of his children and your crew. Both traditional music and a few cranks of the new-fangled gramophone accompany the beautiful ceremony, and then its bon voyage!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800471</GUID><Text>Convince the king your crew's affection is genuine</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800475</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The king is delighted to see his children wed.&lt;/b&gt; Delicate understanding of local custom and a smattering of their language allow a message of true love to be conveyed. The king evidently thinks his children in good hands. Feasting, and to the amusement of all, terrible dancing, follows. For his departing children, it shall be the longest, most fascinating honeymoon.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800476</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Something is lost in translation.&lt;/b&gt; Yet the king smiles benignly, as if your crew still have a chance to prove themselves. 'He suggests a great hunt,' says your diplomat, 'or else we may await arcane judgment.' His eyes flick to a copper oracle on a dais.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800478</GUID><Text>Capture the king a prize animal</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800480</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hunt goes quite well.&lt;/b&gt; Beautiful boars inhabit the woods, and though tricky to catch, are little trouble for your experts. Though the king will still not allow you to leave with his children, the feast of boar brings everyone together in the moment. The lovers understand this moment is all they have, and the next morning there is an acceptance that it is time to part ways.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800481</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hunt is not perfect.&lt;/b&gt; The crew show courage in pursuit of a tiger, which draws the king's admiration. Sadly, they cannot catch it, which leaves the king wondering if your men will be able to provide once married. Thus, he decides not to let his children leave. Some of your crew remain committed to staying behind, and it is with regret you must continue without them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800482</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your naive hunters fail the test.&lt;/b&gt; Forest deer are everywhere, and hunting them hardly seems a challenge. Had your so-named 'hunters' any respect for nature, they'd have realised the sacred deer were not what the king was after. Instead they gather them up greedily. The king makes it perfectly clear your expedition must move on. With heavy hearts, the sailors return to the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800479</GUID><Text>Face the verdict of the copper oracle</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800483</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The oracle predicts a reassuring fate for all.&lt;/b&gt; Those who wish to remain for love will live fulfilling lives, but the same shall be true for those still committed to your expedition. All parties feel a sense of peace. Your voyage shall continue without any resentment towards those it leaves behind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800484</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle is disappointingly undecided.&lt;/b&gt; The king cannot, in good faith, allow his children to leave to an uncertain destiny. His ultimatum is that your crew become part of his extensive family or else they must leave alone. Though understandable, it is nevertheless regrettable when some decide to stay behind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800485</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle predicts that your souls cannot be saved.&lt;/b&gt; With your crew rotten to the core, the king makes it clear there can be no union with his children, and that you are no longer welcome. Heart-broken and bearing the burden of sin, the crew return to the triviality of duty.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800477</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The awkward gestures and diagrams in the sand&lt;/b&gt; prove highly offensive to the king and his people. Sensing outrage, the crew back away towards the ship. The angry locals fire arrows at their former amours. Fittingly, one is struck in the heart, and bleeds out into the brine. The rest return lovelorn, to their dreary maps and compasses.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800472</GUID><Text>Await the verdict of the copper oracle</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800486</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle sees only purity in your crew's hearts.&lt;/b&gt; It predicts a bounteous future for the king's children, and so with tearful pride, he gives the couples his blessing. The traditional ceremony is both spiritually uplifting and wholesome.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800487</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle reveals a little doubt in your crew's hearts.&lt;/b&gt; The king interprets that his children will only be happy if they remain on the island., and that some of your sailors are not in love, but merely infatuated. Still, you must lose the fine crew who have formed genuine bonds.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800488</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle reveals great doubt in your crew's hearts.&lt;/b&gt; The king does not for a minute believe that your inconstant crew are as deep in love as they claim. If they cannot demonstrate otherwise, it might be better if your people left.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800490</GUID><Text>Try to convince the king your crew are worthy</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800492</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Careful diplomacy has him thinking twice.&lt;/b&gt; Perhaps there is a way for the crew to prove themselves. A lean champion steps forward. Fighting him may impress the king, or else you can try and outhunt him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800494</GUID><Text>Propose a contest of champions</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800496</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You have your champions.&lt;/b&gt; One-by-one the suitors fight the king's champion. Those who prevail, it turns out, are permitted to take their lovers to sea. Some fail, but can at least drown their sorrows during the farewell celebration that follows.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800497</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is not a pleasant sight for the faint of heart.&lt;/b&gt; Your best champion is put forward, and subsequently knocked about the head for the entirety of the contest. At the end a cloth is needed to conceal the disfigured face. The king expresses his condolences for your loss, but all is fair in love and war.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800495</GUID><Text>Propose a hunting competition</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800498</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is close but the king's champion is outfoxed.&lt;/b&gt; By sundown your best hunter has claimed six boars to their five. The king will still not allow you to leave with his children, but the feast of boar brings everyone together in one moment. The lovers understand a moment is all they have, and the next morning there is an acceptance that it is time to part ways.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800499</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Lacking the skill, your hunters try to cheat.&lt;/b&gt; Without knowledge of the island's fauna, they decide to follow the king's hunters in the hope of poaching the animal they are tracking. But they are led a merry dance. Three days pass, and your champion is missing presumed dead. The crew have no choice but to depart, tail between their legs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800493</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The king is offended by your insolence.&lt;/b&gt; Without a word he boards a boat and heads out to sea. Some foolishly follow, believing he can be reasoned with, but they have even less knowledge of local boats than local customs. Their bodies will be dredged from the reef as your tactless expedition struggles on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800491</GUID><Text>Order the crew to leave at once</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800500</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Paradise lost!&lt;/b&gt; The expedition may be back underway, but the mood is abject as the beautiful island becomes but painful memory. Too painful for one, who is discovered dead, it is said, by way of a broken heart.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800489</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle proclaims your crew's hearts sinful and wicked.&lt;/b&gt; Arm-in-arm with their new-found amours, the sailors await some happy answer. But the moment the king's arm is raised, daggers unsheathe, plunging into the hearts of the would-be lovers. Speechless and unharmed, the rest are free to leave the island, pondering the grave cost of faithlessness.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800473</GUID><Text>Leave without the crew who've fallen in love</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800501</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is a significant blow.&lt;/b&gt; Any happiness the crew might feel at their comrades finding love is consumed by feelings of resentment. How could they have been so selfish? The expedition goes on, but those who are still a part must take on twice as much work.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800112</GUID><Text>Temple of the Monkey God</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800114</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;With water supplies so low&lt;/b&gt;, the sight of an island waterfall elicits a mighty cheer from the crew.

A warning, a threat? And who put them there? Since the nearby island is uninhabited, it is sensible only to think the perpetrator must be aboard. The crew must know or have seen something last night!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801003</GUID><Text>Ask the anthropologist</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801006</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'For good luck,'&lt;/b&gt; remarks the anthropologist, inspecting the spherical red dolls, 'for the setting of goals, and perseverance in achieving them. Some people or spirit of this place believe they can help us home.' At this, your crew are beguiled.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801004</GUID><Text>Ask the crew who did this</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801007</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew are beginning to bond.&lt;/b&gt; Someone comes forward, not having expected to cause such a bother. 'They're for me old mum,' he sighs, 'birds - that one's a little robin. Made 'em together when she was ill. Now she's gone...I...' The others are quick to put an arm round his shoulder; they're all in this together.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801008</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No one has anything to offer but the priest.&lt;/b&gt; It is his belief that some unholy chapter has opened. The next morning, more of the eerie things have appeared. 'Cleanse the idols in holy fire!' he shrieks. 'Nonsense,' says a soldier. "Set guards within, and we shall have this rat."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801011</GUID><Text>Side with the priest and prepare a holy fire</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801013</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The priest gloats over his success.&lt;/b&gt; With a maniacal grin, he sets the mound of idols alight. The fire consumes rapidly, shifting vermillion to viridian. Some say they hear the wood scream as it goes. 'Expurgation is God's work, and I am chosen.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801014</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The fire is chaotic&lt;/b&gt;, and the buckets of water seem not to extinguish, but provoke. The flame leaps to the priest's cassock like spring-heeled jack, and as it sweeps up his back, he is heard to utter his last words, 'forgive me father, for I have sinned.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801012</GUID><Text>Keep guard and capture the perpetrator</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801015</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The teenagers are remorseful.&lt;/b&gt; 'It was a jape, a piece o' trickery sirs, we regret t'were not received so.' The crew are forgiving - the youths merely wished to contain their homesickness - and call for just fifty strokes of the birch per bottom.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801016</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;That night, dire musket-shot is heard.&lt;/b&gt; A dead boy on deck, local. A second is seen diving to blue. Next morning a rhythm comes from an armada of river boats, armed with guns. There island is inhabited, and they know what you have done.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801018</GUID><Text>Engage in battle.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801020</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;One warning salvo is enough.&lt;/b&gt; The river boats cluster and slow. Though they lower their weapons and allow you to leave, the anger that your crime goes unpunished couldn't be more marked in their faces.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801021</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your ship is a sitting duck.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew cannot man stations fast enough to fire or manoeuvre. Enemy boats surround your ship, before scaling its sides. The blood shed on both sides will stain this ship and expedition forever.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801019</GUID><Text>Leave immediately</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801022</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Once your ship is underway she is free.&lt;/b&gt; Nevertheless your adversaries are excellent shots, and do damage to the sails and aft. The crew will have to make repairs in the days that follow.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801023</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A traumatic escape.&lt;/b&gt; In the hurry to leave, your ship is spun broadside and exposed to gunfire. There are injuries, but none so deep as the sight of the dead boy's accomplice below. He weeps, and clutches one of the idols - a good luck charm.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801017</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sun is solemn that morning.&lt;/b&gt; The bodies of the dead guards are borne to the hold for burial, but not here, upon this cursed rock. Who killed them none know but the sinister effigies. The expedition fumbles on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801009</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A destructive episode.&lt;/b&gt; No one has information, or perhaps they withhold it. Consensus tends towards the latter. Someone wants this expedition to fail, and these effigies are a threat. Paranoia festers. At the next port, a large part of the crew opts to quit.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801005</GUID><Text>Throw them overboard and move on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801010</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Chilling.&lt;/b&gt; As instructed, the crew collect the dolls and throw them overboard. But relief lasts only until the following morning, when the dolls are found returned, placed exactly as they had been.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802040</GUID><Text>Mutiny!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802041</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Clear skies, calm seas, and mutiny!&lt;/b&gt; The tension has been building. The everyday strains of an expedition — the rationing of supplies, a lack of recognition from the officers — it has all become too much for the lower-ranks to take. They are refusing to take further orders, and have united behind a charismatic spokesperson. It won't take much to push them to a full-blooded revolt!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802042</GUID><Text>Arrange a meeting with the leader of the mutiny</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802046</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They soon reach an understanding.&lt;/b&gt; After all, the demands made by the mutineers are perfectly understandable. The officers address each of the criticisms of the running of the ship, agreeing where possible to make adjustments — and where they find it's not possible, they take the time to explain exactly why things must stay the way they are. Everyone seems most satisfied with such a fair and democratic resolution.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802047</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The threat of mutiny is gone, for now.&lt;/b&gt; The negotiations begin well, but ultimately remain unresolved, with the first mate too stubborn to make compromises for his inferiors, and the mutineers seemingly unable to see the bigger picture. After a long and tiresome debate, the mutineers agree to disagree, and grudgingly begin taking orders again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802048</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Their leader insists you meet on his turf.&lt;/b&gt; "The officers will join us among our squalid bunks, or there'll be no meeting," he says with more than a hint of threat.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802049</GUID><Text>Agree to meet in the sailors' quarters</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802051</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The leader of the mutineers listens to reason.&lt;/b&gt; That an officer is willing to meet on the lower decks already shows progress has been made, and the humility he then proceeds to show, while listening to the many gripes and grumbles of the crewmen, is enough to defuse the situation — even if nothing has really changed at all...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802052</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The meeting goes nowhere.&lt;/b&gt; It is clear the problem lies with their leader. He is a force of nature, too incendiary for any of your officers to handle. With each new compromise offered by your representative, he makes further, more unreasonable demands. Something must be done, and fast.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802054</GUID><Text>Quietly poison him</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802057</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor agrees to be an accomplice,&lt;/b&gt; and his complicity proves vital. Dispensing with his moral objections, your medic produces a poison that causes rapid respiratory failure. A man known to be loyal to the captain secretly administers it, and within a few days the chief firebrand of the mutineers is dead. "Cancer of the lung," says the doctor, "most probably caused by stress." No-one suspects a thing, but the officers must keep a terrible secret.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802058</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is obvious you tried to poison him.&lt;/b&gt; The doctor refuses to help, objecting, "It's despicable — and besides, I know nothing of poisons." Instead, you're forced to rely on the help of the ship's cook. The "wine" he concocts is discoloured, and obviously reeks of death, but the poor fellow is too drunk to notice. Unfortunately for you, the doctor chooses to issue an emetic, and saves the firebrand from his untimely demise. "The bastards tried to kill him!" scream the mutineers, as &lt;b&gt;they converge upon the captain's cabin.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802059</GUID><Text>In a final attempt to keep order, offer a bribe</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802061</GUID><Text>This will be costly.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802062</GUID><Text>Okay</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802064</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They take the bribe, but their loyalty cannot be bought.&lt;/b&gt; The trust between the commanding officers and the crew has been shattered. Since there appears no single culprit, it is agreed that all senior officers be put on probation so that any member of the crew may hold them to account for their actions henceforth. Needless to say, the general mood among the officers is low.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802063</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802065</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Blood is the only payment they will take.&lt;/b&gt; Weakened by the poisoned wine, the leader of the rebels appears on a crutch. His followers part in taciturn awe, as he hobbles forward. "Name your scapegoat," he says. One of the junior officers draws the short straw. "Cut out his eyes!" And with two gruesome oyster scoops, the hierarchy aboard your ship is turned upside down. The captain has no choice now but to grant several of the rebels positions of authority aboard ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802060</GUID><Text>Fight them: officers vs. sailors</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802066</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's a bloody end, but your officers can fight.&lt;/b&gt; Their academy training stands them in good stead as the dissident rabble charges. The sailors, equipped with hooks, nailboards and anything else they can find, are no match for your sabre-slashing redcoats. Although the mutiny is over, and its leader, too ill to fight, is safely in the brig, it's unlikely all those radical ideas have simply died with those who had held them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802067</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The officers show themselves unworthy of power.&lt;/b&gt; Without loyalty, pride, or even discipline, the redcoat defenders are broken by the rabid horde. The leader of the mutineers, still groggy, makes an example of one of the officers, forcing him to drink the same deadly wine he was given. The captain has no choice but to grant the rebels positions of authority aboard ship. It will be a rocky ride from hereon.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802055</GUID><Text>Have him arrested</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802068</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The leader comes quietly,&lt;/b&gt; perhaps because soldiers loyal to the expedition have knocked and asked politely — it's more dignified that way. He is on his own now. Guards are stationed all along the route to the brig, separating him from his followers. Without their leader to organise and motivate them, the threat of mutiny becomes little more than a grumble.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802069</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The rebels are ready to die for their leader.&lt;/b&gt; It could have been a quick and clean arrest, but the mutineers crowding around outside their leader's quarters don't seem afraid. When a fracas sparks into life, they are vicious. The officers jab their swords nervously into the pack, knowing that what they do is wrong. With the loss of life, and the loss of trust, things look grim for this voyage.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802056</GUID><Text>Ignore him</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802070</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The mutineers leave the expedition.&lt;/b&gt; The captain and the officers, having failed to provide a solution, cannot hold them to their contracts. Equally, as the senior ranks have refused to negotiate, the leader of the mutineers is now honour bound to take some formal action. An uncomfortable week of silence passes before you make port, and a large portion of the crew leaves as soon as you dock, taking food and other supplies with them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802053</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your representative is utterly tactless.&lt;/b&gt; It is late, he has had too much gin, and he barges into the sailors' quarters barking insults and commands. The crew toss aside their paperbacks and swing down from their hammocks, laying into him with their fists. Perhaps they don't intend to kill him, but nevertheless, that's what they achieve. To settle the matter, the captain agrees to keep their crime a secret, so long as there's no more talk of mutiny.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802050</GUID><Text>That's enough disobedience — arrest the chaplain</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802071</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The leader comes quietly,&lt;/b&gt; perhaps because soldiers loyal to the expedition have knocked and asked politely — it's more dignified that way. He is on his own now. Guards are stationed all along the route to the brig, separating him from his followers.

In fact, when the inevitable fracas whirls into action, they are vicious. The officers thrust their swords nervously into the pack, knowing that what they do is wrong. With the loss of life, and the loss of trust, things will never be the same again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802043</GUID><Text>Give the ringleader a raise</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802073</GUID><Text>The ringleader looks on greedily</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802074</GUID><Text>Okay</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802076</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A pragmatic solution.&lt;/b&gt; The amount offered to the man to buy his obedience is enough for him to ignore the incongruity of a monetary settlement — a bribe, as it's more often known. What's more, he's willing to spread the lie that change is afoot. It's not long before the storm of mutiny has passed overhead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802075</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802077</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;He refuses, insisting you negotiate on his turf.&lt;/b&gt; "Give us what we ask, or this mob'll turn, I guarantee it," he threatens.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802044</GUID><Text>Make an example of the ringleader</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802078</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The budding mutiny is crushed.&lt;/b&gt; The first lieutenant and two loyalists are all it takes to seize the ringleader and present him before the captain for judgement. The man is condemned to a marooning on the next island they encounter. The swift arrest and punishment impresses the sailors, and renews their respect for their superiors.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802079</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The loyalists find it difficult to act against their friends.&lt;/b&gt; "Go on then, arrest them!" blares an officer, when they show a moment's hesitation. The ringleader is eventually captured, made a scapegoat and marooned at the next port, but weakness has been shown. A few little cracks have started to appear...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802080</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The rebels are ready to die for their leader.&lt;/b&gt; It could have been a quick and clean arrest, but the mutineers crowding around outside their leader's quarters don't seem afraid. In fact, when the inevitable fracas whirls into action, they are vicious. The officers thrust their swords nervously into the pack, knowing that what they do is wrong. With the loss of life, and the loss of trust, things will never be the same again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802045</GUID><Text>Ignore the threat of mutiny</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802081</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The mutineers leave the expedition.&lt;/b&gt; The captain and the officers, having failed to provide a solution, cannot hold them to their contracts. Equally, as the senior ranks have refused to negotiate, the leader of the mutineers is now honour bound to take some formal action. An uncomfortable week of silence passes before you make port, and a large portion of the crew leaves as soon as you dock, taking food and other supplies with them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802203</GUID><Text>The Amazons</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802204</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The splendid warriors are all women.&lt;/b&gt; Exploring this deserted settlement — which appears to have been the scene of a revolt — seemed a good opportunity for some looting, but your crew aren't the only ones to have had the idea. As they pass the barricades of barrels, tables and chairs, they happen upon a group of warriors, with not a man among them. Indeed, the long-trousered women assume a defensive formation so fluently, it's possible they are more than human.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802205</GUID><Text>Let a woman do the talking</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802208</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;She fascinates the warriors,&lt;/b&gt; almost as much as they fascinate her. "Many stray into our territories, but rarely does a woman lead them," says the tallest of the goddesses. Neither she nor the others make any further mention of these territories, how far they span, or if their people dwell in towns and cities. Your crew are invited to share in what they have found, however. As the women lope into the trees, eyes ever watchful, you wonder how they will repurpose all they have harvested from these ruins. It is your belief they may have stumbled into this chaos, from a distant, more noble age.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802206</GUID><Text>Present your peaceful intentions</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802209</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They too share a love of exploration and discovery!&lt;/b&gt; Though they know nothing of your language, your envoy takes great pleasure in unravelling his sea chart. Curiosity soon loosens them from their formation, as they crowd around him, sitting on their shields to get a better view. He describes the ship in gestures, and when he gets to the sails, for some reason they fall about with laughter. One of them snatches the map, and makes a suggestion as to where you might think of going next. It could be a shortcut!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802210</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The behaviour of your diplomat is disgusting.&lt;/b&gt; Instead of trying to communicate your good intentions, the belching toad circles them, looking them up and down as if to appraise their value. When he places a greasy hand on one of the warrior's cheeks, another woman breaks from the pack and plants her lance in his thigh.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802211</GUID><Text>Respond to their violence in kind</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802213</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Firing a few shots skyward is enough.&lt;/b&gt; The warriors have only shields and jagged lances, coming as they do from some nobler age. Yet the way they fearfully scurry away suggests they are no strangers to firearms. It feels like a missed opportunity to have got to know them better. All that's left is to tend to the sorry diplomat, whose leg has a very severe bleed. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802214</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They are too fast.&lt;/b&gt; The distance between your small scouting party and the warriors is made up in moments, as the lithe women dive and roll, and thrust their lances. All your men are killed. The warriors spare your women, however, giving them only wearied looks as they stalk away. The survivors return to the expedition ship, and report the massacre to the others.   </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802212</GUID><Text>Placate them with gifts</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802215</GUID><Text>The warriors seem interested, but watchful</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802216</GUID><Text>Confirm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802218</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your exotic supplies intrigue the warriors.&lt;/b&gt; Their curiosity overtakes their anger, and seeing how fascinated they are by the crew's maps, the sailors guess that the women might share in their taste for exploration. Sadly, it appears too late to earn the warriors' trust, and they depart looking cautiously over their shoulders. You must tend to the sorry diplomat before you leave, as the bleed from his leg looks severe.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802217</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802219</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The warriors take great offence.&lt;/b&gt; One of them spits on the jacket of an officer. He responds by moving to draw his weapon, but the women are too fast. The lithe warriors dive and roll, and thrust their lances. Every man in your small scouting party loses their lives. The women are spared, however; the warriors giving them only wearied looks as they stalk away. The survivors return to the expedition ship, and report the massacre to the others.   </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802207</GUID><Text>Bow before the goddesses</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802220</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew's deference pleases the warriors.&lt;/b&gt; Surprised by the sailors' genuflection, the women giggle and lower their guard, lifting your explorers' chins with the tips of their lances. They may not speak your language, but their body language is unequivocal — they are fellow adventurers, and wish to celebrate your meeting. A huge bonfire is made from the wooden barricades, and all enjoy their boozy punch and haunches of venison — which the women insist on eating raw. The wild party lasts long into the night. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802221</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Not everyone in your party shows respect. &lt;/b&gt; Some are snickering about something, and the warrior women presume it concerns them. They spit at the men, who reach hot-bloodedly for their weapons.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802222</GUID><Text>Challenge them to a fight</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802224</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;This pleases them,&lt;/b&gt; since out of everything, they are always most fond of a good fight. Your men are honourable and choose to fight hand-to-hand. It is a noble and even contest, punctuated by the metallic rasp of sword and spear, ending in stalemate. Both combatants have suffered injuries, and the two sides part with greater respect for their foes. Still, their wounds will need looking after...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802225</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They are too fast.&lt;/b&gt; The distance between your small scouting party and the warriors is made up in moments, as the lithe women dive and roll, and thrust their lances. All your men are killed. The warriors spare your women, however, giving them only wearied looks as they stalk away. The survivors return to the expedition ship, and report the massacre to the others.   </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802223</GUID><Text>Accept humiliation and leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802226</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors, especially the men, feel humiliated.&lt;/b&gt; "Those warrior women were strident," says one, "I had absolutely no idea how I should respond to such provocation. They wanted us to draw our swords, which of course would have been wholly inappropriate!" The women, on the other hand, can't help but dream of escaping this suffocating ship, to take up a lance and shield of their own.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802672</GUID><Text>The Fugitive</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802673</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Local authorities come aboard looking for the fugitive you've taken in.&lt;/b&gt; A man in rags offered you his services in a port, saying he'd do any odd job for some food and the chance to join your crew. The captain agreed to take him on. He soon grew on your sailors, working hard and filling in wherever needed. But above all he has proved a man of principle — a champion of the vulnerable — and as such, the crew have learned to respect his silence on the matter of his past.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802675</GUID><Text>Pretend you haven't seen him</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802679</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew stick stoically to the same story.&lt;/b&gt; "This man," the officials say, holding up a picture of their new friend, "have you seen him?" "Oh no, no," your sailors reply. Still, the officials conduct a cursory search, but the man of many talents has no difficulty in hiding from them. When they've gone, there is a hearty cheer. "Glad to have you with us!" bellows the captain. You have a new recruit!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802680</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your attempt at deception fails.&lt;/b&gt; The officer in charge lies that your ship has never docked at the port in question, yet the officials present a logbook stating conclusively that it did. This only serves to further rouse suspicion that he is somewhere on board.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802681</GUID><Text>Quickly, hide him!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802683</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Hidden in plain sight!&lt;/b&gt; Sensing how thorough the inspection is going to be, there's only one possible bolthole for your runaway. "Get in the lifeboat, and keep your head down," the crewman whispers, while his pursuers are being detained on some pretence in the captain's cabin. To complete the plan, the lifeboat is then winched above the eyeline, where sure enough, the authorities never think to look. Not wanting to cause further trouble, he insists on leaving at the next port.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802684</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"There he is! Seize him!"&lt;/b&gt; The fugitive is still trying to make himself comfortable among a pyramid of barrels when his pursuers appear. They tackle him and clap him in chains.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802685</GUID><Text>Don't let them take him</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802687</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They don't give in easily.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors wait until the officials pass them by before knocking them to the floor, and confiscating their weapons. A shrill whistle sounds from the other ship, and armed men in smart navy uniforms pour up the boarding plank onto your deck. There follows a heavy skirmish, but your sailors gain the upper hand. The authorities surrender and retreat. Though grateful, your fugitive wishes to avoid causing further injury by his presence, and insists on leaving at the next port.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802688</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The fugitive dies,&lt;/b&gt; along with his pursuers. When your men try to lay hands on the port officials, they put a pistol to the fugitive's head. "Try to stop us, and he gets it," they say. When your men try to be clever, they blow the fugitive's head off, then do the same to one of your men, before they themselves can be subdued. The dead prisoner was very popular aboard ship, and your crew wonder if things could possibly have turned out worse.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802686</GUID><Text>Let them take him</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802689</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew offer no resistance.&lt;/b&gt; They part before the two officials as they frogmarch the fugitive over the gangplank to their vessel. He tries to express his thanks to your crew for their efforts, but the official growls "no more of your activism", and slaps him sharply across the chops. The prisoner was very popular aboard your ship, and your crew believe more should have been done to defend him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802682</GUID><Text>Threaten to destroy their ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802690</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your threat is impressive indeed.&lt;/b&gt; Rows of dark, iron mouths poke from their hatches, ready to fire at point blank range! "You must be mad!" says one official, as they skip back across the gangplank to their own ship, suddenly most anxious to leave! Your fugitive is thankful, but does not wish to endanger your expedition further, and waves a warm goodbye at the next port.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802691</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your men hesitate at the order,&lt;/b&gt; because they can see the neighbouring ship is not one to be trifled with. Eyeing your sailors as they not-so-secretly prepare for battle, one of the officials sounds his shrill whistle, and a troop of navy-uniformed soldiers rush up from below deck. They fully intend to board you.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802692</GUID><Text>Fight them!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802694</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They don't give in easily.&lt;/b&gt; A second shrill whistle sounds from the other ship, and the navy-uniformed brigade pour up the boarding plank and onto your deck, where your men sit ready for them. There follows a heavy skirmish. Some are injured, but your forces prevail. The authorities surrender and depart. Though grateful, your fugitive wishes to avoid causing further injury by his presence, and insists on alighting at the next port.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802695</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's no time.&lt;/b&gt; Your men, still concerned with preparing for the sea battle, are thrown into disarray. "To deck, men! To deck!" is the cry, as they dive for their guns and rush to the deck, only to be cut down, one-by-one by the men in blue. "Fools!" smirks the official, as the fugitive is trussed in chains, "To think so many died for this worthless streak of spittle... Take him away!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802693</GUID><Text>Let them board ship and take the man</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802676</GUID><Text>They'll have to fight you for him</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802696</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You have a new recruit!&lt;/b&gt; "You're welcome to him!" says the more senior of the two officials brightly, "We had no idea he was so important to you." His colleague glances at him nervously, before wrinkling up a fake smile of his own. It's obvious they only chose to call off their pursuit because your vessel is far more powerful than theirs. With your ship free to continue, the former fugitive raises a glass. "Thank you all," he says, "here's to a triumphant expedition, and beyond!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802697</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The officials seem undaunted.&lt;/b&gt; "Oh, I think we have little to fear from a ship as ill-equipped yours. Still, from your hostility, it's clear you're hiding the man we seek." They signal back to their own vessel to ready arms. &lt;b&gt;"Now... think carefully. Do you really want to refuse to give him up?"&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802698</GUID><Text>Demonstrate your firepower!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802700</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's a point blank exchange,&lt;/b&gt; in which your ship manages to get the first shot, disabling half the men opposite. As such, the return fire is not so crippling as it might have been— although significant repairs will still be needed. As the two ships drift apart, the officials are left in helpless, comic isolation on your ship's deck. Someone gives them a good old shove overboard, forcing the other ship to return to rescue them. Your crew make their escape. "I will burden you no further," says the fugitive wearily, "please, allow me to alight at the next opportunity."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802701</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It only serves to demonstrate your crew's incompetence,&lt;/b&gt; because they are still not ready! The vessel belonging to the local authority fires first — and at such close range, the effect is devastating. Half your gunners lie maimed, and your ship is shredded through. You wave the white flag. The fugitive leaves with the officials of his own free will — after all, he has better chances of survival almost anywhere else!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802699</GUID><Text>Surrender the fugitive to them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802702</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew offer no resistance.&lt;/b&gt; They part before the two officials as they frogmarch the fugitive over the gangplank to their vessel. He tries to express his thanks to your crew for their efforts, but the official growls "no more of your activism", and slaps him sharply across the chops. The prisoner was very popular aboard your ship, and your crew believe more should have been done to defend him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802677</GUID><Text>Offer to pay the fugitive's bail</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802703</GUID><Text>The fugitive wears a look of stoic resignation, as his terms of release are discussed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802704</GUID><Text>Confirm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802706</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You have a new recruit!&lt;/b&gt; "I will repay your trust in me tenfold!" says the talented fellow, as the local authority departs with their payment. He raises a beaker of navy rum, "Thank you all! Here's to a triumphant expedition, and beyond!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802705</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802707</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You can't afford him.&lt;/b&gt; Seeing that your men are still reluctant to let the fugitive go, the order is given to lower the footbridges, and a troop of navy-uniformed soldiers file into line, ready to board your ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802678</GUID><Text>Hand over the fugitive</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802708</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The fugitive does not resist.&lt;/b&gt; With a look of stoic resignation, the man offers the officials his hands to be shackled. He turns back one last time before he goes, to say "Thank you for everything," — dignified until the very last. The crew shall miss his company greatly.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803537</GUID><Text>The Coral Island</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803538</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The storm came from nowhere, wrecking your ship on coral-strewn shores.&lt;/b&gt; For a time your crew feel like children again — dancing along the sand and bathing in the sun, as they await a verdict on the damaged hull. When it comes, the news is not good: extensive repair is needed, and with supplies so short, there is considerable disagreement. Why &lt;b&gt;concentrate on repairs&lt;/b&gt;, given how long that may take, when both&lt;b&gt;food and water&lt;/b&gt; are so urgently needed?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803539</GUID><Text>Your naval architect has a grand plan...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803540</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The architect unveils a breathtaking sketch for the repair.&lt;/b&gt; Seeking shade and isolation almost from the moment of the shipwreck, the architect devotes every ounce of concentration to their art. The result is a watertight schedule of renovation for the damaged hull, that aside from securing your swift departure, reminds all of the incredible talent committed to this expedition.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803541</GUID><Text>Explain why fixing the ship is paramount</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803542</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You make good progress on the ship repairs,&lt;/b&gt; by offering a specific motivation: "If we can get her fixed, there's a friendly port not far away." While she's not yet ready to depart, the crew are reassured that it won't be long before the ship is back underway. It might be an idea, meanwhile, to send a small party to look for food and water — you never know when the next chance will come.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803543</GUID><Text>"Don't be distracted now — not when we're so close!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803544</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Everyone is in agreement that the ship, their home, is of the greatest importance.&lt;/b&gt; By the time the repairs are done, she looks an absolute picture. A sailor has good fortune and finds an equally beautiful conch on the beach. "A keepsake for my son, Ralph," he says, "he'll love it".</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803545</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You can forgive the crew for being slightly distracted;&lt;/b&gt; the work is hard, and they've been at it constantly. No amount of encouragement can speed things up. When the ship is ready, the expedition leaves immediately in order to remain on schedule.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803546</GUID><Text>"We can spare a small hunting party"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803547</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You find great quantities of exotic paw-paws — and something else with paws!&lt;/b&gt; "It was alone and frightened, so we decided to adopt it!" says the chubby bespectacled sailor. The crew rejoice at having a new friend aboard, and as if inspired by the little pup rolling around, they finish the repairs in double time.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803548</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ship has been repaired, but the hunters still have not returned.&lt;/b&gt; You'd better decide if it's worth the risk to go after them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803549</GUID><Text>Go after them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803550</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You should have sent the second group first!&lt;/b&gt; Your team have no difficulty tracking the original hunting party to the dense heart of the island, where they have somehow managed to get themselves lost. Perhaps it was all that fermented sapodilla fruit they've been eating! The captain jokes that the woozy-looking bunch should finish the repairs alone, but everyone is just glad that they've been found.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803551</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Prey to themselves!&lt;/b&gt; The deeper inland the search party venture — and this island is far larger than first they thought — the more animal they become. "The beast... the beast!" they say, believing something terrible stalks them, when all the while it has been within them. A huddle of the original party are found in a cave: scratched, kicked and bit. Neither group will speak of it when they return to the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803552</GUID><Text>Wait for them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803553</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They return just as those waiting on the beach have started to lose patience.&lt;/b&gt; Everyone can see the hunters are rested and well-fed, having taken advantage of their little excursion at the expense of the many — and yet they claim they have found nothing. The ship sets off under a small grey cloud.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803554</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The reaction is lukewarm,&lt;/b&gt; and so is the effort: days pass and the work barely seems to move on. The remaining supplies are scarce. In the place they've been logging, one of the sailors finds some exotic mushrooms and brings them back to camp. Could this mysterious fungi be key to survival?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803555</GUID><Text>Ask the botanist</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803556</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your expert happens to take more than a mere amateur interest in mycology,&lt;/b&gt; and recognises these to be excellent-tasting mushrooms. Those fussy about fungi will have to learn to see them as fuel, because that breach in the hull needs fixing! Within a few days, the ship is ready, and your expedition can resume.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803557</GUID><Text>Try to discern if they're harmful</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803558</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your precautions are sensible.&lt;/b&gt; A volunteer rubs the mushrooms on the back of the hand, and finding no visible reaction, touches it to his lips, then tongue, before tentatively holding it in his mouth. By this process it is adjudged safe, but the men boil it up just in case: rubbery but nutritious. Within a few days, the ship is ready, and your expedition can resume.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803559</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Yes, they are harmful.&lt;/b&gt; "Go ahead and eat — the white ones are usually edible," says the doctor, who is no expert in caution, let alone fungi. Alarm bells ring when a sailor clutches his belly, and drops to his knees. To which do you attend — your sick or your boat?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803560</GUID><Text>Persuade the crew it's not worth the risk</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803561</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew see sense and wade through the repairs.&lt;/b&gt; By the good fortune of being waterside, they also happen across the odd fish, crab or mollusc, which keeps everyone going until the work is done. Within a few days, the ship is ready, and your expedition can resume.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803562</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew won't listen, and eat the doom 'shrooms.&lt;/b&gt; "We're good for nothing on an empty belly!" they say, but alarm bells ring when a sailor drops to his knees. To which do you attend — your sick or your boat?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803563</GUID><Text>They look angelic, take a gamble</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803564</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They are indeed heavenly,&lt;/b&gt; if lacking in quantity. Your crew's trust in the divine appears well-placed, and the repairs proceed without further incident. Within a few days, the ship is ready, and your expedition can resume.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803565</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;These are Destroying Angels.&lt;/b&gt; Alarm bells ring when a sailor clutches his belly, and drops to his knees. To which do you attend — your sick or your boat?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803566</GUID><Text>"The sick must be our priority!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803567</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor is competent enough, at least,&lt;/b&gt; to purge those affected with castor oil. It's a deeply unpleasant experience, but the crew bond, and take some determination into the repairs. Within a few days, the ship is ready, and your exhausted crew are able to drift towards the nearest safe harbour to recover.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803568</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"A harmless experiment!" says the doctor quickly,&lt;/b&gt; whipping some ricin seeds from a coat pocket. "Normally it would be castor oil used to purge their bowels, but I wonder if the seeds wouldn't do the same?" Unfortunately, the doctor's seeds are extremely poisonous. In just a few hours, the patients are all dead. Devastated, and far fewer in number, the survivors take forever to complete the repairs. Exhausted, they drift to a safe harbour to try and recover.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803569</GUID><Text>"We're all running out of time: fix the boat!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803570</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew understand this is all about survival,&lt;/b&gt; and take a newfound determination into the repairs. Those poisoned by mushrooms are close to death, but show grit and determination in self-treatment, and manage to pull through. Within a few days, the ship is ready, and your exhausted crew are able to drift towards the nearest safe harbour to recover.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803571</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The words serve to scorn the sick and the weak,&lt;/b&gt; their meaning in effect being, "if you can't defend your share of what's left, you don't deserve to survive." It is only much later, when the ship is in port, that your brutes rediscover their compassion. They realise the expertise they've left for dead — those misfortunate enough to have been poisoned by mushrooms, or indeed, for having shown any other human frailty.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803572</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Sadly, the absence of belief comes through in those words.&lt;/b&gt; No-one seems to think repairing the ship on the remaining rations is possible. "We're all going to die here!" they say, "unless someone stronger takes charge!" You'd better offer a more democratic process, or else keep them fed, or there's going to be trouble.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803573</GUID><Text>Organise life on the island democratically</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803574</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The new system does ease the frustration a little.&lt;/b&gt; In order for every opinion to receive due consideration and respect, only one holding a conch shell may speak, and they cannot be interrupted. Though the bureaucracy is both frustrating and incongruous in the circumstances, it at least allows everyone to have their say. Gradual progress is made on the hole in the boat, and the expedition eventually resumes.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803575</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Democracy doesn't hold for long.&lt;/b&gt; "It's stupid that I can only talk when I have a shell in my hands!" says one, "I'm the one who found the fish that fed us yesterday — I should have the right to decide!" Before long, the crew is lost in needless quarrels. The ship repairs barely progress in the coming weeks, and by the time the sailors can finally depart this vexatious coral island, they are close to starving.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803576</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The system creates confusion and division.&lt;/b&gt; "Listen to someone because they're holding a shell? What do you take us for?" The first mate leans raffishly from a rock wall, "If you want to do things properly around here, come with me!" &lt;br/&gt;From this moment on, things deteriorate rapidly. The island turns into a battlefield, with hoarded resources becoming motives for murder and betrayal. Only a chance passing ship, seeing smoke signals, comes to the rescue. They are kind enough to repair your ship, and wish the encrimsoned dregs of your expedition better fortune in their future endeavours.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803577</GUID><Text>They just need to eat, that's all</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803578</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The food does ease the frustration a little.&lt;/b&gt; Since fish and fruit now seem so easy to find, there is disgruntlement that this wasn't made the priority on arrival. Grudges aside, the crew are a lot sharper, and manage to get the work on the ship done despite a general lack of expertise. The expedition eventually resumes.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803579</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hunters find a piffling amount of food,&lt;/b&gt; and with blood sugar levels low, the arguments are relentless. Fights and scuffles break out over the most trivial things, and the ship repairs barely progress in the coming weeks. By the time the sailors can finally depart this vexatious coral island, they are close to starving.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803580</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's nothing to eat, anywhere.&lt;/b&gt; Repairs to the hull seem inconsequential when people are dropping like flies. But if hunger is the devil, those fallen bodies are the deal: best eaten while they're still fresh. From this moment on, things deteriorate rapidly. The island turns into a battlefield, with hoarded resources becoming motives for murder and betrayal. Only a chance passing ship, seeing smoke signals, comes to the rescue. They are kind enough to repair the ship — and wish the encrimsoned dregs of your expedition better fortune in their future endeavours.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803581</GUID><Text>Agree to hunt for food and water</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803582</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The island is alive with animals.&lt;/b&gt; While trapping a few pygmy deer, your hunters encounter a pig's head on a stick. It is rotten and buzzing with flies. As the crew move close, a filthy old man with a beard to his waist cavorts from the trees — surely a castaway who has never been found. "Don't touch him, don't touch him!" he shrieks, before turning to the pig head, "My lord, I hope these troublemakers didn't disturb you?" You aren't sure this loon can be saved.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803583</GUID><Text>Talk to the old mariner</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803584</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Something changes behind the old man's eyes&lt;/b&gt; upon hearing the spoken word again. "Forgive me — my Lord receives few visitors to his kingdom. Pray, from what kingdom come you?"&lt;br/&gt;When they describe his own homeland, the old man begins to weep. "Home! They want to take me home!" He bows to the pig head. "My Lord, with your permission I would leave your service and... Oh really, my lord? Thank you, thank you so much!"&lt;br/&gt;There are plenty of supplies for the ship, and over the next few days' voyage, the old man slowly recovers his humanity, regaling the fabulous tale of his marooning.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803585</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The onslaught of words seems to rile him up,&lt;/b&gt;"Get away, devil interlopers!" He dances towards a keen-tipped spear, and jabs it at any who draw near. "We don't believe you! My Lord does not believe you! You had better leave before he gets angry!" The crew feel so claustrophobic with this man, and the fly-coated pig's head, that they run back to the ship. The voyage resumes without the extra supplies that all had hoped for.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803586</GUID><Text>Leave him to his pig-on-a-stick</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803587</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hunters ignore the madman, and return to the boat.&lt;/b&gt; "Fresh venison!" they cry up the beach, provoking a small cheer from the repair crew. Meat turning on a spit provides a good incentive, and the hull is finished in no time. When all settle down to eat, there is much curiosity about the wildman of the forest, and his pig's head. The expedition continues.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803588</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Since they have found precious little food here, the men start to fight&lt;/b&gt; over who needs it most. Tension is growing, and they will be at each others' throats if nothing is done.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803589</GUID><Text>Calm them down</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803590</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Though it only takes a few words&lt;/b&gt; to remind them of how things would be done in the halls of government back home, the sailors have no choice but to suffer through the ship repairs on dreary rations. After weeks of hard work, the crew are finally able to sail away.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803591</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The argument is rational to a fault.&lt;/b&gt; "If, like you say, it's all about survival, what are we waiting for? Let's weed out all the fat ones!" Fearing mutiny if they do not comply with the wishes of the strong, your officers condone the malicious exile of the weak, allowing them to be left behind when the ship is finally ready.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803592</GUID><Text>Confine dissenters to the ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803593</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Thuggery rules out here,&lt;/b&gt; and following a nasty scuffle, those with the most extreme views are seized and tied up in the ship's brig until the repairs are complete. The remainder get the hull job done, but it's a chore working under the lingering hostile atmosphere.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803594</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Unfortunately, the most outspoken also prove the most savage —&lt;/b&gt; it's about survival, and none of the normal rules hold here. They take vital charts and supplies from the ship to a stronghold up on the hill; a rock formation they have come to call "the castle". Your men lay siege and break through, but lives are lost. Before the expedition resumes, a small memorial — of coral — is erected for the dead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803595</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They make the island seem a barren hell,&lt;/b&gt; their desperate thirst for meat finding no quarry. Repairs to the hull seem inconsequential when people start dropping like flies. But if hunger is the devil, those fallen bodies are the deal: best eaten while they're still fresh. The ship may be recovered, but these men will never be the same again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803596</GUID><Text>Risk mutiny and demand the repairs</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803597</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's good that your craftsmen are so adept,&lt;/b&gt; because the impatience of the entire crew is palpable. Fortunately, by giving everyone something to do, those in charge of the repairs exude a quiet authority. Everyone learns to take pleasure in the details, and before long the ship is at least as fit for the expedition as it was before. They escape the coral corral with a profound sense of togetherness and achievement.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803598</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Another week? Can't you see we're all going to die here!?"&lt;/b&gt; The beefy sailor rips the hammer from the carpenter's hand. Survival instinct has thrown the existing order into disarray, and from this moment on, things deteriorate rapidly. The island turns into a battlefield, with hoarded resources becoming motives for murder and betrayal. Only a chance passing ship, seeing smoke signals, comes to the rescue. They are kind enough to repair the ship — and wish the encrimsoned dregs of your expedition better fortune in their future endeavours.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803744</GUID><Text>Permit A38</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803745</GUID><Text>Not a step forward!" says the harbour master of the big merchant harbor the crew stopped at. "You need to register your galley before doing anything here! Go to the harbour office, the red building, on the first floor corridor B last door on the right."

And close the door, impertinent!" </Text></Text><Text><GUID>803749</GUID><Text>Threaten him to get the information</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803750</GUID><Text>Visibly intimidated, gives direction.

Go to window 1 second floor fourth corridor"&lt;/br&gt;One of the sailor notices a smirk on his face but is too happy to finally have a direction to question it.&lt;/br&gt;At window 1, two ladies talking and refusing to answer the sailors request, they claim they are not abilited but the official stamp is on their desk.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803752</GUID><Text>Win them over so they deliver the authorization / Be nice, not usual costumer</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803753</GUID><Text>The sailor listens carefully to their conversation and notices the exact right moment to get into it. "You are so right! It is shocking that she  had to let her maid go because she has no more money? I am utterly chocked!" &lt;/br&gt;"Exactly!" answers the lady, "but she claims she fired her because she prefers to do the housework herself but I know that..." &lt;/br&gt;The conversation goes on for a few minutes then one of the ladies command the sailor on his niceness and politeness. She agrees the sign the authorization.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803754</GUID><Text>Sailor push himself into the conversation. Feels really rude. The two ladies refuse to help them out and order them to leave their office immediately.

No way I am helping you!" "Give us the Permit!" screams a sailor. "No we are here to immatriculate a galley!" screams the other.&lt;/br&gt;"Out, all of you!" the lady screams. The sailors lost hours for nothing, the ship is forced to leave the harbour.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Shut the metal window</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803758</GUID><Text>Take the stamp on their desk discreetly</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803759</GUID><Text>Pretend to check on papers on the desk and succesfully manage to grab the stamp while the ladies have a lively discussion.

They wait for the person in charge for two hours and when he arrives, the old lady whispers a few words to him while looking at the sailors.

Perhaps he is right, for this resupply has not been as uneventful as hoped. Only the first evening moored in this bay, and a man goes missing - tracks up the beach into jungle. Many wonder how work can be expected to continue...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800281</GUID><Text>Bait the creature</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800286</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;With the perfect lure&lt;/b&gt; placed enticingly in the crook of a tree, there is an inevitability about a capture. Sure enough, yellow eyes pierce the darkness, and a mighty beast pads softly over to the bait. A net is hurriedly cast about it and secured, thus leaving the expedition free to resupply unthreatened.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800282</GUID><Text>Send hunters to track it</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800287</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your huntmasters are expert,&lt;/b&gt; and trace with great care, the soft hollows imprinted by feline paw. Led to a clearing, they correctly judge this to be a lair, where they stand ready with a net. When the cat returns, heaving hot breath, the hunters pounce. With net secure, the expedition is free to resupply unthreatened.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800288</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;At least one hunter did the right thing,&lt;/b&gt; and kept his eyes open while they traced the beast's pawprints. Another was not so wise, and was heard to let out a scream. His comrades were drawn to the spot, and struck the majestic beast down. But not before the damage was done.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800289</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Three days pass, and still no word.&lt;/b&gt; There is a common feeling something must be done to save those men.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800290</GUID><Text>Send a rescue party</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800293</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is only something of a relief&lt;/b&gt; when the rescue party return. It's bad news... the hunters are dead. The rescue party described the bright and long-maned beast, and how in a tussle, they slayed it. With the bodies of the hunters buried, the expedition is able to resupply in an atmosphere of respectful silence.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800294</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Horror! It's picking us off one by one!'&lt;/b&gt; bawls a fearful sailor, for now the rescue party too, have failed to return. There is nothing for the disconsolate remainder of the crew to do, but leave this sorry place behind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800291</GUID><Text>Wait a bit longer</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800295</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Doubtful prayer brings no news&lt;/b&gt; of the lost hunters. The men have nowhere to look for guidance, and there is a burdensome feeling that a decision must be made.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800296</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Conviction in the lord is of little use here,&lt;/b&gt; it seems. Two days later a hunter, whose leg is mangled, limps back into view. After the necessary amputation, he is heard to groan that the others perished. All must leave this savage place.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800292</GUID><Text>Leave the island without them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800297</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'We leave them for dead,&lt;/b&gt; when they could be right there now waiting for us!' cries a furious old tar. Like so many others, he is disgusted that good men should give their lives for nothing but impatience!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800283</GUID><Text>Speak with locals</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800298</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Absurd magic, but it works!'&lt;/b&gt; say officers sent to the inland village for help. Having described the beast, they were referred to a witch. She encouraged them to ingest live scorpions, one of each colour; yellow, red and black. This they did reluctantly, but found when they confronted the animal, it took flight. All promptly follow the witch's advice, and sure enough, remain undisturbed for the remainder of the resupply.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800299</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Our plight means nothing to the locals,'&lt;/b&gt; bemoan the officers sent as diplomats. 'Telling them beasts stalk the jungle, is as like alerting a hatter to the presence of hats on his hatstands.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800300</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Their deity is desecrated!'&lt;/b&gt; urges the officer sent as diplomat. All around the bay, daubed faces appear, bows raised to the expedition camp.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800301</GUID><Text>Teach them a lesson</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800303</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'A hollow victory',&lt;/b&gt; say the men. For the locals lie dead, but the jungle beast stalks on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800304</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Odds against them, the men fight as best they can.&lt;/b&gt; Fought back onto the sand, they deflect the rain of arrows with whatever they can lay hands on. A relay is able to return precious equipment to the ship and set sail, but not without a number of casualties, of whom some do not make it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800305</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The onslaught is deadly.&lt;/b&gt; Few among your crew have the requisite experience to defend themselves, and so the sand reddens with their blood. Of those who make it as far as the expedition ship, a number succumb to the poison-tip arrows. It is a massacre.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800302</GUID><Text>Run for the ship!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800306</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Run!' comes the panicked cry.&lt;/b&gt; The men drop their work, and tramp desperately through the shallows to the ship. A volley of arrows pierces three, squirting crimson into the clear blue. 'Dead aside, we have lost a great deal more in provisions than we have gained,' laments the quartermaster, as your ship departs that wretched bay.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800284</GUID><Text>Lay a trap</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800307</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ingenious powers&lt;/b&gt; of the craftsmen among your crew have fashioned a pitfall for the beast. There is not long to wait before there is a tinkle on the handbell, and all can gather above the trap to see the monster growling at its bottom. The resupply may now happily proceed, knowing that danger is averted.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800308</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The beast is too intelligent&lt;/b&gt; to fall for makeshift traps. It is clearly evading the pitfall prepared by those supposed to be the expedition's deftest craftsmen. 'Little more we can do,' they shrug.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800285</GUID><Text>Leave the island</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800309</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'It's a considerable setback,'&lt;/b&gt; say senior officers. Fresh water, wood for burning, plants for medicine - it does no good to list what myriad opportunities are missed in bypassing the bay. And all for the sake of fears over one measly wild animal.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800605</GUID><Text>A Grizzly Encounter</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800606</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Bear attack!&lt;/b&gt; The party ponder this very real possibility as threatening grunts stop them dead among the firs. Fifty yards ahead, a huge specimen lurches up on two legs like a totem, standing between them and escape. More grunting echoes nearby. The party stay silent, awaiting guidance.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800607</GUID><Text>Scare the bears away</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800611</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Boooooom!&lt;/b&gt; The valley shudders with the sweet stench of exploded dynamite. The bears hurry away, leaving the crew thoroughly entertained at the superiority of mankind and the power of invention.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800608</GUID><Text>Use hunting knowledge to get the better of the bears</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800612</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Trust in the expert hunters never feels misplaced&lt;/b&gt;, even when they recommend the party break into passionate song. For singing the shanty 'Cheerly-ay-oh' brings the crew together, whilst also dispersing the wary bears deep into the forest.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800613</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hunters lack guile.&lt;/b&gt; They have enough to lead the crew on a route silent as a church, but not enough to stop a bear sniffing them out. It's easy to believe from its vacant eyes, that it sees you as a potentially delicious kind of threat.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800615</GUID><Text>Attack the bear</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800617</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The bear's face proves a good target.&lt;/b&gt; Ducking the terrifying whooshes of its paws, someone manages to prime their pistol and shoot it through the eye. The bear drops dead. No-one feels particularly good about killing it, but the way ahead is now clear.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800618</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Adaptation is good when a fight isn't going well.&lt;/b&gt; The bear flinches but does not drop after the first round of gunfire. There is no time to reload, before it is upon them with its paws. Knocked down the men are smart enough to play dead. After an hour or so facing the floor, the bears lose interest and leave. The crew are able to lick their wounds, and move on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800619</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's easy to underestimate mummy bears.&lt;/b&gt; As the soldiers fluff the loading of their weapons, the bear nonchalantly grasps one by the wrist, and sinks her jaw into his neck. The others panic and flee with their arms in the air. She pursues a second, striking him dead against a rock. Now she and her cubs can finally be left in peace.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800616</GUID><Text>Outmanoeuvre the bear</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800620</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes it helps to know your hill contours.&lt;/b&gt; The crew carefully fall away, circumventing the bear's position, and keeping their backs to the mountainside. With the higher ground, the bear appears to lose interest. Hearts pumping, the crew hurry to safety.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800621</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Stupidly the crew decide to run, and reach a dead-end.&lt;/b&gt; The bear pursues at a leisurely speed, yet with no less menace, and the crew are forced to seek refuge in a cave, or else try climbing the trees.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800623</GUID><Text>Hide in the cave and pray</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800625</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Against all anxiety, the Bear doesn't follow.&lt;/b&gt; Still, the men in the cave are too afraid to light a fire, or sleep through the night. Shattered and hungry, they emerge the next morning, only to find their sacrifice was wholly unnecessary.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800626</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Bears can see terribly well in the dark&lt;/b&gt;, and since your crew have stumbled into its house, where its vulnerable infants sleep, it is not very happy. The crew that do manage to break for daylight have clothes ragged and torn, and cannot speak, for it is clear they were the lucky ones.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800624</GUID><Text>Climb the trees</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800627</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew climb the trees well enough&lt;/b&gt;, but the bear isn't going to make their lives easy. It is a full day and night before it gives up shaking trunks, or climbing halfway up towards the dangling crew. When it finally leaves, the exhausted crew descend, their nerves in shreds.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800628</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Bears are awfully good at climbing trees&lt;/b&gt;, and as on this occasion, it is not uncommon to see them strike their adversaries from the branches. Its hapless victim plunges from the canopy and lands like a sack of red berries on rocks below. Others injure themselves as the men drop from the trees in a desperate escape.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800614</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Call themselves hunters!&lt;/b&gt; The tracks thought to lead away from bear territory go instead to a clearing at its heart. The bears at first seem alarmed their picnic is disturbed, until they realise your crew are on the menu. The sound of crunching bone rings in the ears of the few that manage to flee.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800609</GUID><Text>Attack the bear blocking the way</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800629</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The lone bear's haunch is picked out with expert marksmanship.&lt;/b&gt; It staggers before bounding off into the woods. Your crew are delighted to return to the safety of the ship, whilst also having done the mighty beast no lasting harm.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800630</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The first volley of shots miss&lt;/b&gt;, and the bear attacks. A second shot finds its mark, and the wounded bear escapes into the trees, but a man lies dead. His brother cries revenge, and is already off into the woods to hunt the grisly killer.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800632</GUID><Text>Track the wounded bear with him</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800634</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Bittersweet.&lt;/b&gt; Your fine tracking skills allow the crew to catch up with the bear and watch it from hiding. It is a she-bear, and is now nuzzling its young cubs. 'That is why she killed him,' says the brother, gone all vitriol. 'Let us leave, and hope my brother's spirit may somehow live on in this place.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800635</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hot-headed hunt is a success none celebrate.&lt;/b&gt; Once found, the bear no longer has strength to defend itself. As the brother drives a stake into its heart, it gives over with a last sad sigh. In that moment a tiny cub pads into the open, crawling weakly under the limp arm of its mother. If only they had understood, the crew could have saved the heartache.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800636</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Hunting is impossible with passions running this high.&lt;/b&gt; When another man snaps a twig, the vengeful brother attacks him wildly, and the others fail to intervene. The brother's eyes glaze as he slides to the earth, bayonet in his back.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800633</GUID><Text>Leave the fool behind</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800637</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The decision is unpopular.&lt;/b&gt; 'Stubborn 'til the end,' say those in the minority. But the greater part have things to say on the subject of dishonour. 'Those brothers loved each other to the end,' remarks one old sailor, 'and what little love did we show for them...'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800631</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Out here, bears rule.&lt;/b&gt; The wildly inaccurate gunfire serves only to rile the bear into a frenzy, and draw attention to your position. Then a second, larger bear thunders from the undergrowth and mauls a man to death. A few of your piffling soldiery manage to escape with all their limbs attached.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800610</GUID><Text>Use camouflage</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800638</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The bears have no chance.&lt;/b&gt; Indeed, the camouflage is so good, the crew can barely see one another! Thickly daubed in the colours of the forest, the chameleon crew bypass the bears with ease. A story of ingenuity at which their grandchildren shall marvel!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800639</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Even the most hardened sailors find the smell unbearable.&lt;/b&gt; Not to mention the indignity of covering oneself in bear excrement for longer than is perfectly necessary. Eventually though the bears depart, leaving the reeking crew free to have a much-needed wash.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800640</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Dressing as pantomime trees is a bad idea&lt;/b&gt;, and as the bears attack, the flimsy branches the crew intended to cover their faces prove no more effective in self-defence. The ensuing scene might have made for an impressive spectacle on the stage, though only as the most gruesome of tragedies.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802299</GUID><Text>In the Grasp of the Tentacular </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802300</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Could it be the kraken?!&lt;/b&gt; What else could possess "tentacles wide as a barrel and long as bowsprits", as your lookout claims to have spotted protruding from the treacle-black swell? Creature of legend or not, a shadow below the surface is hurtling towards your ship at full speed!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802301</GUID><Text>Fire a torpedo at the thing</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802304</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hulking cephalopod is no match for the torpedo!&lt;/b&gt; The self-propelled projectile requires no special effort to dispatch, and yet its underwater prowess is indisputible. It crashes into the kraken with a wallop that sends a profusion of octo-bits frothing to the surface. The crew are delighted to discover the flesh is cooked, yet not at all rubbery.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802305</GUID><Text>Kill the monster</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802306</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;THUNK! An excellent shot!&lt;/b&gt; The harpoon lodges into the creature's amply-sized brain. It takes little effort to haul the reddish mantle and decimette of long pulpous limbs aboard. No-one is going to believe this trophy when they see it — or that something of this size swam at such threatening velocity! Its eyes alone are half a metre wide!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802307</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Sloppy shooting from your pod of suckers.&lt;/b&gt; The twisting aberration slinks and jets obliquely, its mantle engorged and thrumming with arcane energy. Its lip-like suckers pucker and latch onto the hull, levering its beaked face up above the starboard rail in a game of peek-a-boo. It is vast!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802308</GUID><Text>Slice its meaty tentacles!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802309</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The monstrosity detaches violently!&lt;/b&gt; Your men hack fiercely and without relent at a key tentacle until it severs. The loopeyed beast blubbers a pained raspberry, coating the deck with plankton-infused clamminess, before tearing itself back into the sea, with a large section of your ship in tow! Some repairs will be needed!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802310</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There are just too many legs!&lt;/b&gt; Having been interrupted at dinner, your sailors try to improvise a dissection with their knives and forks, but the monstrosity refuses to become calamari. Its innumerable tendrils cavort, punching holes and tossing sailors at whim! One unfortunate sailor is flung so perfectly that his return trajectory lands him directly, and fatally, atop a flagpole. Having satiated itself on flesh and timber, the kraken detaches, and bolts away with typical flourish.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802311</GUID><Text>Blow it away!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802312</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Right in the mandibles!&lt;/b&gt; The kraken inhales the slew of heavy artillery and is propelled outwards and star-like, before plummeting to the depths with a good part of your ship still in its grip. Repairs will be needed! You cannot think why the creature was so offended by your presence, but at least it now has some memento of your meeting to clutch onto.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802313</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your gunmen cannot keep their feet long enough.&lt;/b&gt; The ctenidious cephalopod rocks the ship to and fro, shaking your boys from the big guns, before sealing itself over an open window and sucking up men as if it had a straw in an ice cream sundae. Eventually, after deciding it's poked and prodded enough, the monstrosity relinquishes its goily grasp, and flops back to the deep to digest the better part of your crew into a liquid.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802315</GUID><Text>Outrun the thing</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802316</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A powerful spurt of propulsion!&lt;/b&gt; The unnatural power of your steam ship eclipses the jetting shadow from the far, far depths. The ship's horn sounds a farewell salute to the creature, who those present swear is equipped with two clocktower eyes, within which ink-black pupils swim delirious. For now, it seems, its wait for a suitable mate must go on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802317</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The wind is with you.&lt;/b&gt; Whatever that bird-beaked nest of serpents below actually is, it relaxes in its piston-like pursuit of your ship once your crew have succeeded in catching the best of the prevailing breeze. Those present swear it was equipped with two clocktower eyes, within which ink-black pupils swam delirious. For now, it seems, its wait for a suitable mate must go on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802318</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew cannot manage to disentangle themselves,&lt;/b&gt; for the creature is in search of a mate, and filled with frightful lust. Only once it has clambered up the side, and attached its hectocotylus to your ship, does it begin to have misgivings about the romantic potential of this union, and start thinking about dinner instead...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802320</GUID><Text>Teeth of the Mountain</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802321</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A track leading over these impenetrable mountains should be a blessing,&lt;/b&gt; yet your men are having doubts. Your guide, for a start, absolutely refuses to follow the path. In fact, the very idea scares him. At the base of the mountain, which juts ferrous and fibrous above the greenery like a chunk of braised meat, is a stone head carved in the rock. It grins awfully, and between its huge square teeth is what appears to be a severed arm.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802322</GUID><Text>Follow the track</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802323</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The trail leads through the centre of a hilltop village,&lt;/b&gt; the straw shelters improbably nestled between steep-sided slopes. But it is the appearance of the inhabitants that astonishes: unlike all the other peoples of this great rainforest, they are tall and pale, blond-haired and blue-eyed. "But why? What can their story be?" someone chuckles, only to find their companions are oddly tense.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802324</GUID><Text>Approach the inhabitants</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802325</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat establishes a common heritage!&lt;/b&gt; At least, their language certainly suggests as much. There are familiar sounding terms such as "gonne" and "gun", for example, although their words for water, tree and mountain are consistent with local dialects. Their mythology appears to centre around a tall, blue-eyed ancestor, who came long ago from the Old World, and eloped up this mountain with a local woman in order to conceive the eagles who now circle its peak. Your party receives the stories with great interest, and are made to feel very welcome.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802326</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your envoy's approach is based upon an assumption.&lt;/b&gt; "Hello!" she exclaims suddenly, "What brings you to these godforsaken hills?" But the villagers cannot understand her. They begin to close in on her.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802327</GUID><Text>Rescue her</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802328</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;She is saved, at least.&lt;/b&gt; "Feels like we killed one of our own today," says a soldier, in reference to the villager they shot. "Not really..." another replies, "...but it's terrible he had to die, nonetheless." Your expedition leaves the mountain pass quickly, so the pale and mysterious community can mourn this violation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802329</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The enemy take the high ground,&lt;/b&gt; their guns and projectiles proving rather effective for them. They rush their hostage to the neck of the pass, and up onto a large rocky outcrop. It's the perfect cover from which to assault your party, exposed as they are on the bald crest of a slope. Men are dying — it's hopeless to remain. Later, when imagining the fate of the poor diplomat, the survivors cannot help but remember the stone head they saw, and the human limb in its jaws.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802331</GUID><Text>Leave her</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802332</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's a dreadful feeling.&lt;/b&gt; Scrambling down the mountain, your expedition hears a sudden and piercing scream. "You never know, she might yet survive," someone remarks — but later, as they are imagining the fate of the poor diplomat, your survivors cannot help but remember the giant stone head they saw at the foot of the mountain, and the human limb in its jaws.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802333</GUID><Text>Watch from a distance</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802334</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is an opportune moment&lt;/b&gt; that your expedition chooses, skirting around and rejoining the mountain track further ahead. Aside from what is most likely to be some distant Old World heritage, there is nothing especially remarkable about the daily business of this tribe, except that they are far too focused on collecting honeycomb from a very tall tree to notice you.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802336</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Not too clever.&lt;/b&gt; Fearing exposure up on the slopes, your men opt to tiptoe through the village. Perhaps they just smell too delicious, because the pallid, hungry-looking villagers emerge from their dwellings as one, equipped with all sorts of sharp-looking implements...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802337</GUID><Text>Apologise for trespassing</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802338</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat finds common ground,&lt;/b&gt; although not what you might expect. It just so happens that these people are about to tuck in to a feast of human remains. Your diplomat reassures the expedition, "It is their practice to eat their loved ones when they die. Rather beautiful when you think about it." Nevertheless, your crew are rather pleased not to have to partake, and continue on their way.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802339</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat fails to control her nerves.&lt;/b&gt; She breaks down whimpering, and one of your manly men muscles in front of her. "Now listen here!" he bellows, "Get back you fiends! Get back or I'll cut you down!" Yet, pale and uncomprehending, still they come. Your brute wavers, and looks as if he's seen a ghost. He turns and runs down the mountain with the others. It will be a hard road on from here.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802340</GUID><Text>Draw your weapons!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802341</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Where discretion fails, force prevails.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew are unfazed by the singular appearance of the villagers, and spring into action. The villagers' expressions remain resolute, even as they flee up the mountain to take refuge with the condors. But there is sadness behind those eyes: this isn't fair. Your men loot the village.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802342</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Many amongst your expedition will be eaten,&lt;/b&gt; or so your survivors believe. They should have fought as if their lives depended on it, but the ferocity and ingenuity with which the mountain ghosts took them was a great shock. The question as to the provenance of the local people has only become cloudier, but those who fled the mountain will not forget them any time soon.  </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802343</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your explorers find themselves surrounded.&lt;/b&gt; Those leading the group have their heads so buried in their maps, they fail to notice they've blundered right through a village. The villagers are oddly tall and pale, with blue eyes and blonde hair. They look hungry, and are equipped with all sorts of sharp-looking implements...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802344</GUID><Text>Avoid the tracks</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802347</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A shortcut may have been ignored, but fair progress is made regardless.&lt;/b&gt; Declining the invitation to enter the territory of whomever made that gruesome stone carving, your crew feel a sense of relief, despite the extra effort the alternative route will demand of them. Along the way, your officers surmise that transgressing into the territory of the local people is seldom necessary, or desirable.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802348</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Avoiding the tracks means getting lost,&lt;/b&gt; the steep contour of the valley overwhelming what limited grasp of the geography your explorers have. They emerge a week of aimless wandering later, devoured not by the cannibals rumoured to inhabit these parts, but by the mosquitoes and leeches so at home near the flooded river.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802351</GUID><Text>Cities of Gold</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802352</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The faded ink... The gold leaf... Could this map lead to El Doodah?&lt;/b&gt; It fluttered into the hands of your sailors, who believe it to be the most bona fide clue in centuries as to the location of the city of gold. They're already dreaming of the hulking neckchains they'll find, and how well they'll set off their earrings. Why, even the captain has suggested hiring a guide! Yet the greedy have come this way before, and it never seems to end well...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802353</GUID><Text>Hire a guide</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802354</GUID><Text>El Doodah, you say? Yes, I know something about it...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802355</GUID><Text>Confirm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802356</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;He has been searching for the Mesoan city his whole life,&lt;/b&gt;  and the intensity with which he examines the map suggests he is on the verge of a breakthrough. "Further west than I've ever been," he looks to the forest "but there's no reason it couldn't lie beyond Lake Guavatita". A few days' hike up the river basin and Lake Guavatita shows herself, just like the jagged dagger of water on your map. Beside a high waterfall, &lt;b&gt;your guide shows you a stone marked with Mesoan glyphs. &lt;/b&gt;"This marks the end of the trail," he says.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802357</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802358</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Looks like you're on your own.&lt;/b&gt; The guide scoffs at your valuation of his services. "Everyone from here to Porto Tristeza will hear what a greedy bunch of conquistador pigs you are!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802359</GUID><Text>Read the map yourselves</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802361</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The trail ends at a stone covered in glyphs.&lt;/b&gt; Following the confluence of high waters, as they weave in and out of one another, you arrive several days later at the lake marked on the faded map. A keen-eyed young whippersnapper notices some unmarked stones have been placed at regular intervals, which culminate at a waterfall, besides a stone whose inscription must have been made long ago.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802362</GUID><Text>Interpret the Mesoan glyphs</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802363</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You strike gold!&lt;/b&gt; Metaphorically, at least. Your anthropologist reads from the glyphs, and scampers off yelling, "The fourth rain god! It means North!" When the archaeologist wades back through the small lagoon, they have a big smile on their face, having found a hoard that's of far greater archaeological value than its financial worth! This may not be the city of El Doodah, but it's remarkable enough!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802364</GUID><Text>Survey the area</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802365</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A secret passage!&lt;/b&gt; In a nearby rock face you find a gap, scarcely wide enough to slip through, that might easily have been missed but for the thoroughness of the search. One-by-one, the expedition enters to find themselves in a natural cavern, through which a cool wind whips. A little light reveals &lt;b&gt;a rock fall blocking the way ahead,&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;crawlways branching in all directions.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802366</GUID><Text>Clear the rock fall</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802367</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What wonders laid bare!&lt;/b&gt; A sturdy scaffold is built to support the ceiling, before a human chain clears the debris. The antechamber ahead radiates with shining metals! It is a hoard of far greater archaeological value than its material worth! This may not be the city of El Doodah, but it's quite remarkable enough!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802368</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The whole roof seems to give way!&lt;/b&gt; Perhaps they should have thought to secure the ceiling first, for as they move a large stone, a primeval bellow comes from above. "Run! RUN!" is the cry, as they all rush out. When the noise subsides, the crew return to discover the passage has been sealed. In any case, some have been injured by the falling debris, and must urgently be taken to a doctor.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802369</GUID><Text>Investigate the crawlways</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802370</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your cavers triumph!&lt;/b&gt; The clammy confinement of the narrow tunnels makes them hard to negotiate at first, but your potholers never lose their sense of direction, pushing forward on their tummies until a fresh breeze tingles. "There! A city!" The cavern opens out into an extensive underground ruin, preserved by its clay surrounds. El Doodah or not, there are no doubt some remarkable finds to be made!     </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802371</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Few have any experience of caving.&lt;/b&gt; The route they take is clammy and claustrophobic, and seems to be leading nowhere when there's a sudden and awful screeching of bats! A man loses his footing and falls through a gap, breaking his leg. The confined space means his rescue is especially tiresome, and takes several hours to complete — the narrow cave filling with moans whenever anyone so much as grazes the injured leg. &lt;b&gt;You are forced to abandon your search for El Doodah.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802372</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Not so much as a glimmer of this golden city! Not even behind the waterfall,"&lt;/b&gt; the lieutenant teases, "and besides, these 'glyphs'..." He drops to his haunches and feels the grooves in the stone, "Looks like plain water erosion to me." The captain nods. "Alright men, you heard the lieutenant. Time to give up this fool's errand." Your expedition leaves disappointed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802373</GUID><Text>Divine the meaning of the glyph stone</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802374</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Praise be, a secret passage!&lt;/b&gt; One of the men is unexpectedly knowledgeable on Mesoan theology. "That symbol's in my improving bunk book sir, Cap'n, sir — means god of the underworld." Sure enough, in a nearby rock face, your crew find a gap scarcely wide enough to slip through, and one that might easily have been missed. One-by-one, the expedition enters to find themselves in a natural cavern, through which a cool wind whips. A little light reveals &lt;b&gt;a rock fall blocking the way ahead,&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;crawlways branching in all directions.&lt;/b&gt; </Text></Text><Text><GUID>802375</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The glyph stone provides no inspiration.&lt;/b&gt; "It's a myth! A lie!" Your frustrated lieutenant kicks at it. "Did we expect this golden city to simply descend upon a cloud for us?" The captain sees only one way to dispel the frustration. "Alright men, you heard the lieutenant. Time to give up this fool's errand." Your expedition leaves disappointed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802377</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your men succumb to their greed.&lt;/b&gt; The map must have been a cruel hoax! The worst thing was that it raised their hopes. Some of its landmarks — a high waterfall, a boulder improbably perched — are found to really exist. Beyond that, there's nothing — yet gold fever has already set in. Weeks, months go by before some of your people get a grip of themselves again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802378</GUID><Text>Refuse to believe in a city of gold</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802379</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Everyone is disappointed.&lt;/b&gt; Aside from those in it for the riches, many believe a gilt-edged opportunity to unearth important discoveries has been passed up. After all, that is the whole purpose of expeditions such as this, is it not?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802567</GUID><Text>A Fistful of Doubloons</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802568</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ship's coffers have been emptied!&lt;/b&gt; Your purser knew these new recruits had a wicked air about them... As soon as the ship reached port and the sailors were allowed some rest, the three landsmen merged with the local crowd and disappeared - and with them went weeks of pay! The theft was planned in every minute detail - your sailors have been robbed by professionals.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802570</GUID><Text>Track the thieves down</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802572</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Their fleeing footprints are easily found.&lt;/b&gt; The tracks of the thieves' limping leader stand out in the dust. The grazing light of the setting sun highlights the path for your huntsmen to follow, leading them away from the town and closer to its river, where the tracks disappear into the water. The hills rise sharply on the other side.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802574</GUID><Text>Look for a ford to cross on foot</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802576</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A safe passage!&lt;/b&gt; The crew's expertise shines as they rapidly spot a shallow part of the river, and cross it without much inconvenience. They go up the sharp hill of the opposite bank and happen upon a vast enclosed field: a pen for horse breeding. A quick discussion with the owner confirms that the thieves stole several animals mere hours ago. The land beyond is barren and unfit for explorers on foot. Your crew needs horses.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802578</GUID><Text>Attempt to catch wild horses</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802580</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The tamed horses easily catch up with your prey.&lt;/b&gt; Your hunters lasso the wild animals and break them, before launching through the barren plains. The blurry hot air parts to reveal the thieves' horses, whose speed is no match for wild ones. Your riders surround them, and the menace of both your numbers, and your drawn pistols soon hushes any resistance. The sailors, satisfied and avenged, retrieve their loot and entrust the scoundrels to the local law.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802581</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors are not made to catch land animals.&lt;/b&gt; The hunt ends in failure, the most your crew saw of a wild horse being the weathered tracks on the dry roads. Instead of leading your hunters to a herd, the tracks point them to a run-down town of wooden buildings - several houses and a single saloon - its lanterns brightening with the growing darkness. Night is well on its way, and tracking the thieves seems almost impossible now.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802582</GUID><Text>Ask the locals for help</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802585</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The locals agree to help.&lt;/b&gt; Your diplomat carefully raises the subject of thieves with a man of imposing authority, the sheriff in charge of the small town. Their modus operandi is familiar to him: a local gang is famous for sneaking around foreign businessmen, but he never would have imagined they'd be so bold as to rob a ship. If the robbery was today, he says, the thieves are sure to come and celebrate at the saloon tonight.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802587</GUID><Text>Wait on the town's balconies, ready for an ambush</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802589</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A clean job.&lt;/b&gt; As soon as the thieves come into sight, your sailors stealthily lay their firearms on the guardrails of the balconies, aiming and firing in rapid succession. The shots resonate through the quiet town: one shot, one permanent sleeper. When the sound and smell of the gunshots settles down, the sheriff salutes your crew's help in getting rid of the local pests, and ensures your sailors that their reputation will be made well known throughout the West.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802590</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Rout.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors fire as soon as the gang comes into view, taking little time to aim and even less to observe their targets. The bullets graze past the thieves and upset their horses, who rear and jump before running away, along with their riders. A night drizzle starts falling, and soon drowns the bandits' tracks. Ambitious yet inefficient, that's as far as the crew's efforts can go.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802588</GUID><Text>Wait at the saloon, ready for a fight</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802591</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Honour and wages are retrieved.&lt;/b&gt;When the gang slams the saloon's doors open, the place is devoid of its usual chirpy atmosphere. Moonbeams disclose the presence of your crew, sat on every possible chair, table and stair step, and already reaching for their guns. The fight is brief. Your sailors overwhelm the thieves and drag them outside, bound and gagged. They pause to salute the sheriff for his help, before heading back to the ship with the satisfaction of a job well done.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802592</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew are no match for the criminals.&lt;/b&gt; When the gang barges into the saloon, the sailors are still arguing over how to handle the fight in such a closed space. The battle is short-lived. Your sailors lack the rough training and ability of their opponents, and can barely fling insults at them, even less punches. The roughed-up crew is thrown outside, and scampers away from the town - very aware of how lucky they are to still be alive.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802586</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew are held responsible for the deserters' actions.&lt;/b&gt; Instead of probing around to get an idea of the runaways' reputation, your diplomat immediately asks about the thieves. The men are well-known - in the worst way - and the locals are shocked to hear your crew hosted them, regardless of the theft. The sailors are forced to leave when surrounded by stern-looking gunslingers. The track ends here. More than money, your sailors have lost morale.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802584</GUID><Text>Avoid trouble and simply give up</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802593</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;So much effort for such a meagre reward.&lt;/b&gt; Feeling the pressure of unseen stares, your crew avoids the shady town and backs away to the harbour city and their ship. Better to decide on your own to withdraw than to be forced to, the sailors tell themselves. Frustration nibbles their thoughts as they set sail.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802579</GUID><Text>Buy horses from the breeder</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802594</GUID><Text>You can choose either to rent, or buy a mount</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802595</GUID><Text>Confirm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802597</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The horses catch up with your prey in no time!&lt;/b&gt; In a flurry of dust and whinnying, the mounts assail the barren plains. The blurry hot air parts to reveal the thieves, perched atop horses that are already exhausted from their mishandling. Your riders surround them, and the menace of your superior numbers, and your drawn pistols, hushes any resistance. The sailors, both satisfied and avenged, retrieve their loot, and entrust the scoundrels to the local law.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802596</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802598</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew will make do on its own.&lt;/b&gt; The price of the withered mares reeks of a scam, and your sailors refuse to pay a single pound for the animals. Their observations might be influenced by the light weight of their purses.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802607</GUID><Text>Get on your horses</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802577</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew find no guarantee of safe crossing.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors quickly get tired of the senseless search: the river's depth cannot be appraised by their untrained eyes, and each segment of the water seems both deep and shallow at once. The crew are too reluctant to try their luck, and abandon their search, disgruntled.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802575</GUID><Text>Create a raft to cross the river</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802599</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A safe passage!&lt;/b&gt; The raft is basic but sturdy, and it crosses the river without losing so much as a plank. The crew board the opposite bank safely, and climb the hill that rises beyond it. On the other side, they happen upon a vast enclosed field: a pen for horse breeding. A quick discussion with the owner confirms that the thieves stole several animals mere hours ago. The land beyond is barren and unfit for explorers on foot. Your crew need horses.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802600</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The raft can't even float.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors bind logs and dead branches together with sturdy knots, but with little actual knowledge of how to assemble a raft. The raft's apparent stability tricks the builders into climbing on to it, and it swirls over the river, wobbling under the weight of sailors and the pressure of the current, before breaking and diving straight into the icy waters below. Few sailors can be rescued from the wreckage.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802573</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No tracks are found.&lt;/b&gt; The bustling harbour and the late evening conspire to hide the thieves' tracks. Your sailors aren't skilled enough to pick up the faint trail inside the town itself, but they might have better luck around the outskirts.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802601</GUID><Text>Keep searching</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802603</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Finally, tracks to follow!&lt;/b&gt; Amidst the numerous footprints left by your sailors, your best huntsmen manage to find the dotted lines left in the dust by the fleeing thieves. There's no mistaking the bent pattern of their limping leader. The prints waddle to the nearest river, where they fade into the water.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802604</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Isn't this humiliation enough?&lt;/b&gt; Your crew keeps foraging through the outskirts of the town, but they still cannot find any tracks.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802602</GUID><Text>Stop these futile efforts</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802605</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your purser protests, but the decision is final.&lt;/b&gt; Going after the thieves, in a territory they seem to know by heart, while the crew itself is in foreign territory?

The woman is eloquent and alert, and &lt;b&gt;she asks to join your expedition.&lt;/b&gt; Once she is safely out of the village, she explains with sadness that the angry young men of a rival family have seized control of the region, and that it would be dangerous for her to remain.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803661</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The odds aren't good&lt;/b&gt; - two against three - and your scouts are knocked violently to the floor. The prisoner is forced to drink, and the vial's contents appear to make her compliant.

They are, however, wary of your capabilities, and agree to relinquish the captive woman in return for your immediate departure. Her relatives soon carry her to safety - &lt;b&gt;but with two casualties of your own, you'd best move on quickly too.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803664</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your reinforcements charge idiotically&lt;/b&gt; into an important local ritual, causing needless bloodshed. When the woman captive is seen being pushed into a grave of bodies, your men have no sense that this is just the theatre of the occult, and — to the bewilderment of the locals — they open fire. &lt;b&gt;The realisation of what they have done will traumatise your men for the rest of their lives.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803665</GUID><Text>Let her go, it's not worth the trouble</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803666</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A dark silence falls over the village,&lt;/b&gt; but for what sounds like the grim clink of shovels on soil.

It seems it was the scream of a young boy: he had been misbehaving, and was given medicine so that ancestors in the spirit world might admonish him, but the medicine seems to have had a bad effect. He is trapped in his nightmares, sweating and screaming all the while. &lt;b&gt;The locals are worried, and look to you for help.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803672</GUID><Text>Make a medical diagnosis</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803673</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor knows botanicals.&lt;/b&gt; In the dregs of the medicine cup, the doctor finds Brugmansia, also called Devil's Trumpet — a hallucinogenic plant known for its power to terrify. Though often used in ritual here, the dosage seems high for a child. The other villagers don't seem surprised, because his parents are the local idiots. The villagers are glad the doctor is able to help pump the poison from the boy's stomach, and after a few days he is back to his usual impish self. &lt;b&gt;Your expedition are proud to have been of help.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803674</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor puts his hands down the boy's throat.&lt;/b&gt; It isn't clear what he is trying to achieve by this, but it causes the boy to thrash violently from side to side. "Damnation!" cries the doctor, yanking out his arm, for the boy has bitten it. Then blood begins to pour from the boy's mouth, and a wriggling pink triangle flops to the floor. He has bitten out his own tongue, and &lt;b&gt;you are shooed angrily from the village.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803675</GUID><Text>Consult your knowledge of world faith</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803676</GUID><Text>"Must be Brugmansia — also known as the Devil's trumpet." &lt;b&gt;Your clergyman is acutely aware of the local religion,&lt;/b&gt; and knows the flower is used to induce spiritual delirium.

Being ignorant of the boy's exact affliction, he falls fearfully back to the age-old redoubt of the cleric: that all around them are wicked heathens.

Suddenly a man grips his shoulder, where a feathered dart now hangs. It could have come from anywhere. Do you &lt;b&gt;hide&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;fight&lt;/b&gt;, or if all else fails, &lt;b&gt;flee?&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803683</GUID><Text>Find cover!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803684</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The rain of darts comes to an end&lt;/b&gt; when your group quickly and cleverly diffuses, each finding their own space. Out of respect, perhaps, your ambushers decide to retreat — or do they simply believe the damage has already been done? Those who were hit begin to wheeze heavily, collapsing to the floor, for &lt;b&gt;the darts are tipped with poison!&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803685</GUID><Text>Identify the poison</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803686</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor is praised for their quickness of thought.&lt;/b&gt; "Wolf's bane, of the slopes above," words pour out, "classically lethal, but by Jove, I have an idea!" An extraordinary antidote is proposed — a posset of deadly nightshade — and its effect is remarkable. "Don't ask me how, but it's worked!" the doctor says cheerfully, as the victims of the poison darts begin to return to normal. Your expedition marks the territory on the map for the sake of anthropology, before taking the long road around it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803687</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Anxious to avoid misdiagnosis, the doctor is slow to react.&lt;/b&gt; Before long, the one who took a dart to the neck suffers opisthotonos — his back arching in spasm, before giving out to exhaustion. The death sparks the good doctor into life. "Ah, so it's strychnine!" he says gesturing to the trees, "Sourced from breadfruit." Chloroform relaxes his patients for a cleansing irrigation, and somehow, they manage to recover. Time to leave this place.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803688</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No-one has the faintest idea.&lt;/b&gt; Those who took darts wear expressions confused and melancholy as they melt into darkness, wondering, perhaps, what the point of their sacrifice was. Your expedition bury the dead as fast as they can, lest the hostile peoples of this particular territory return.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803689</GUID><Text>Knowledge of local practices may yield answers</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803690</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's what the locals know as 'ourare'.&lt;/b&gt; Accounts from the region frequently reference it as a lethal coating for arrowheads, or in this case, blowpipe darts. A treatment is also mentioned — a form of mouth-to-mouth in which the resuscitator acts as an iron lung for the patient. And it works! There is no childish awkwardness, with an excess of volunteers offering to save their fellows. The victims of the poison are saved, and all emerge from those (often dark) hours with a new feeling of togetherness.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803691</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"You always hear stories about poison dart frogs out here,"&lt;/b&gt; says one of the officers. He doesn't seem to know much more than that, except that in a 'Boy's Own' adventure story, chloroform was used to treat frog poisoning. No-one seems to know where the medicine box is, but by the time it is found, someone has already succumbed to convulsions. It is only a slight relief then, that the chloroform does indeed relax the other victims sufficiently to keep their hearts beating. Time to leave this place.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803692</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your barbarous dimwits are ignorant of local customs.&lt;/b&gt; "Do they tip arrows with cyanide, perhaps?" Your officer snaps, wiping sweat from his reddened face, "How the devil would I know what these primitives use?!" Those who took darts wear expressions confused and melancholy as they melt into darkness, wondering, perhaps, what the point of their sacrifice was. Your expedition bury the dead as fast as they can, lest the hostile peoples of this particular territory return.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803693</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Unfortunately, the darts continue to find their mark,&lt;/b&gt; for the hostile tribe know the forest too well. It is fortunate that your ambushers, perhaps seeing the sort of weapons you're carrying, decide to retreat. Or do they simply believe the damage has already been done? The men who were hit begin wheezing heavily, and collapse to the floor, for &lt;b&gt;the darts were tipped with poison!&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803697</GUID><Text>Identify the poison</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803698</GUID><Text>Knowledge of local practices may yield answers</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803694</GUID><Text>Root out and tackle the ambushers</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803695</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It takes all of their calm&lt;/b&gt; for your men to fan into the forest. There's a thud as one of the dart-blowers is struck down with the butt of a rifle. Whistles all around signal a retreat, leaving your men to examine one of the six-foot blowpipes: perhaps they left knowing the damage had already been done? Sure enough, those hit begin wheezing heavily, collapsing to the floor. &lt;b&gt;The darts are tipped with poison!&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803696</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your men make themselves easy targets,&lt;/b&gt; desperately trying to pursue and isolate their adversaries, to no avail. As more of the feathery darts hit home, so too does a realisation of their function. Whistles all around signal a surprise retreat, as those who have been hit begin to wheeze heavily, collapsing to the floor. &lt;b&gt;The darts are tipped with poison!&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803708</GUID><Text>Make a desperate run for it!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803709</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The people of the forest will do all they can to protect it.&lt;/b&gt; As your expedition flees, the poison darts that have stuck in their backs begin to take effect.

A sinister log, seemingly adrift, mutates into the jaws of a dragon. &lt;b&gt;"A gator!"&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803712</GUID><Text>Take the shot</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803713</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Bullseye!&lt;/b&gt; Your skilled huntsman pulls out his rifle and it only takes him one deep breath to put a bullet exactly two inches behind the creature's razor-sharp eye, hitting its marble-sized brain. The monster goes limp immediately and the crew members roar as they lift the legendary trophy above their heads, marking the day your daring huntsman became the dragonslayer.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803714</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The creature's scales are bulletproof!&lt;/b&gt; Your hunters fail to find a weak spot and every shot seemingly ricochets off the monster's skin.

As she stumbles away gripping her limp arm, a sailor sinks a knife in the beast's neck and it slowly stops twisting and wriggling. Everyone is bruised and scratched, and the navigator might never fully recover from her wounds, but she will never forget they way her comrades risked their lives to save hers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803717</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They underestimated the monster!&lt;/b&gt; Two men confront it head on, as the rest of the party watch meekly from afar. The beast snaps the navigator's arm as if it were a twig and launches itself onto the men, fast as lightning. It takes one of them by the armpit and, with a fearsome roll, rips his body apart. Both creature and man disappear in the murky water, leaving nothing but a trail of gore behind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803718</GUID><Text>Run for your life</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803719</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew waddles away as fast as they can, &lt;/b&gt;leaving their navigator trapped in the jaws of the monster. Luckily, the creature is sated with one big bite out of her forearm, and she is free to catch up to her cowardly comrades and escape the situation with nothing but a gruesome scar and an irreconcilable mistrust in her fellow crewmen.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803720</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A tragedy!&lt;/b&gt; Each armed crew member draws their pistol and unleashes a hail of pellets upon the beast. Not only is the reckless manoeuvre utterly ineffective against the monster's bulletproof scales; your petrified navigator is caught between the beast and the open fire. With nowhere to run, she falls an easy prey to the gator. It shakes her tiny body around in its jaws like a puppet and pulls her down to the cloudy water, never to be seen again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803721</GUID><Text>Tackle the beast</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803722</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A legend has been born!&lt;/b&gt; While some members of the crew distract the beast, one bold sailor jumps on the gator’s back and clutches its neck. It takes ten more men to pin the monster's maw shut, but once it's immobilised, the sailor pulls out a knife and sinks it into the monster’s skull. At first the creature twitches, but then it goes limp. The crew members roar as they lift the legendary trophy above their heads, marking the day their daring crewmate became the dragonslayer.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803723</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A miraculous escape!&lt;/b&gt; While some members of the crew distract the beast, one bold sailor draws a knife, jumps on the gator’s back and clutches its neck. But he's no match for the monster's atrocious strength, and it easily squirms out of his embrace, shutting its maw around his arm. With a harrowing howl, the man manages to sink his knife into the alligator's skull, killing it instantly. The stump on his arm shall forever remind him of his heroic feat.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803724</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They underestimated the monster.&lt;/b&gt; Two men confront it head on, as the rest of the party watch meekly from afar.

It's a cocktail I learnt about a few weeks ago, rum and cherry liquor, a delight!" He pours the rum and the content of the bottle into glasses and offer them to the two men. He observes their reaction. As the cook reaches for the glass without hesitation, the assistant winces. "I ... I am not thirsty thank you."

Sailors start to murmur between themselves when unexpectedly one of them comes forward "I know who did it. I am sorry Jimmy but you can't get away with it" he says as he turns toward the cook assistant. 'Jimmy wanted to punish Robert and Charles for mistreating him but he didn't realize the poison would be so strong it would kill them". A murder is a murder, even if unvoluntary.

'We are to act swiftly or he shall die!' says the doctor, as he bores a drill into the man's cranium. Once the blood is drained, the resultant hole is covered with a silver coin, and the head beswaddled with bandages. The man is fully recovered within a few days, and the crew greatly impressed by the actions of the doctor.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800236</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The whole examination takes too long,&lt;/b&gt; 'though a bluish contusion is found under the hair. 'I must act or he shall soon die!' gulps the doctor, but then proceeds to faff nervously through a medicine bag, until the poor man dies on the operating table. 'You did the best you could,' a colleague offers, but there is a hollowness to it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800237</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The patient grabs the doctor's head and smashes it against the table.&lt;/b&gt; The doctor was tapping his knee to check reflex, when the devil cut loose. 'He wants putting out of his misery,' a sailor cries, once the man is wrestled to the deck again. So they cut his throat. Attention turns to the doctor, but he is a doctor no more. Injury has rendered him insensible; an eight-year-old boy trapped in the body of a man!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800238</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Hellish horror ensues,&lt;/b&gt; as the doctor insists on checking if 'ought is stuck in the throat'. As he prises open the lion's jaws, the daemon creature lurches up into his throat. So frenzied is this vampiric assault, that there is little the crew can do but to raise their pistols to the gruesomeness.

Despite all hope for his fast recovery, he dies not two days later, his malady forever a mystery.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800241</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The faithless crew will not trust this to God,&lt;/b&gt; but can neither agree if the possessed man should be thrown to sea, as desired by the sailors, or permitted a chance to see out his ordeal, as demanded by the officers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800242</GUID><Text>Side with the officers and warn the sailors to cooperate</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800244</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors would not dare mutiny,&lt;/b&gt; of course, and return to their stations.

But they need not have worried, since he dies of the unexplained malady not two days later.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800245</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors are outraged&lt;/b&gt; and their response is immediate. In greater numbers they overwhelm and restrain the officers, while the sickly subject of their fury is bound and thrown into the deep.

The crew are too relieved to feel embarrassed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800692</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is obvious you are lying,&lt;/b&gt; and the authorities are not impressed.

There is no choice but to run. As your ship crashes wildly out between jetties, the escort ship pincers, and opens fire. The effect is catastrophic.

The doctor admits to the failure of the tincture, but thankfully has something for diarrhoea.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800891</GUID><Text>The tincture is poison! Having seen their first shipmate choke on his dose, the rest decide they'd rather live with a six-foot tapeworm in their bellies.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800892</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Somehow it works&lt;/b&gt;, and the patients are rid of the parasite. The doctor seems unsurprised, 'human physiology may be complex, but treatment need not be.' A pretty vague case summary, but who cares?!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800893</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Perfect preparation for amputation!&lt;/b&gt; At least that's what your crazed doctor would have you believe. Once her macabre experiment is concluded there is surely only one course of action for the afflicted...the crew are aghast.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800894</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It does go away, eventually.&lt;/b&gt; 'My arm looked like a wormcake for a while,' one sailor laments, 'but that little smattering of holes filled-up with pus now - signs my body is winning the war.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800895</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Mass amputation for all?!&lt;/b&gt; The festering parasites have gnawed their way to bone! Limbs must be chopped, or else their bodies shall rattle with bemaggoted cavities!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800898</GUID><Text>Have the doctor amputate</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800900</GUID><Text>Let nature take its course</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800901</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;As good as could be expected.&lt;/b&gt; Out with parasites, in with polished peg legs and helpful hook-hands. The crew look not nearly as enthusiastic as you might think however.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800902</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Extraordinary that you trusted that quack!&lt;/b&gt; She is sideshow surgeon, carving up her victims with the zeal of a ripper, and the accuracy of a pissing schoolboy. At least the screams will die away soon enough...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800903</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Nothing can save them.&lt;/b&gt; Though a mercy that they may choose their manner of death - unmolested by the ship's quack - it is death nonetheless. The parasite has sucked the life from your expedition.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802083</GUID><Text>The Broken Mast</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802084</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Sailor under the mast!&lt;/b&gt; Weeks of harsh weather have taken their toll on the ship, and the violent gusts of wind this morning have toppled the mizzenmast. For a moment, the ropes tying it to the other masts hold it in place, but there's only so much weight they can take: they break with a snap, letting the mizzenmast plummet on the deck. A sailor now wails, his leg caught under a pole twice his size.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802085</GUID><Text>Cover the leg with a mix of soap and water, and pull it away</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802088</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailor is easily pulled from under the mast.&lt;/b&gt; The foamy water allows the crushed leg to slither away from the debris, and the limb emerges covered in rainbow bubbles and bloody splinters. The man will live - and maybe, with a miracle or two, his leg will mend.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802086</GUID><Text>Cut the leg with a bone saw</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802089</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An extreme but commendable choice.&lt;/b&gt; The sailor is given rum to drink and a cloth to bite before he is held in place, and his leg bound with a tight tourniquet. The doctor's labour is gruesome, and the man can feel the grinding cuts as they tear through him, and he screams through the cloth as he howls and he roars - and yet the doctor stays composed and focused. When the leg is finally cut and the sailor dragged away, the crew feels reassured that they are in capable hands.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802090</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Butchery.&lt;/b&gt; The doctor's hands tremble more than his victim does, and the saw draws zigzags through his patient's flesh, each cut unable to connect with the previous ones. The trapped sailor's screams become whimpers, then silence. The doctor has to be stopped before he can ruin any more of the unfortunate corpse, and his blood-clad figure sends a warning to whoever might need his help in future.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802087</GUID><Text>Lift the mast with a makeshift lever</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802091</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The man is freed.&lt;/b&gt; Using one of the partners broken by the mast, the crew fits sturdy pieces of timber between the deck and the fallen mast, adding plank after plank in the opening, before gradually raising the mast with ropes and pulleys tied to the mainmast. They manage to lift the mast long enough to free the sailor, and the doctor immediately tends to his crushed leg.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802092</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The vague idea of a lever never becomes real.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors try to lift the mizzenmast by rolling logs underneath, but the huge wooden pole is far too heavy for its rolling movements to be controlled. The mast lurches forward and rolls from the sailor's leg to his chest, pushing his insides out. The view stays with the sailors for days before they can finally reach a decent harbour, get rid of the broken mast, and clean up the grisly mess underneath.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802710</GUID><Text>Message In A Bottle</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802711</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Castaways request your help, but where could they be?&lt;/b&gt; Shark-baiting is a common distraction for your sailors, but their latest catch provided much more entertainment than expected. In its belly was a bottle, and in the bottle were three sheets of paper, each a copy of the same message in different languages. Piecing together the documents to make up for their weathered content, the crew can make out a call for help and a latitude, but nothing more.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802712</GUID><Text>Examine the entrails of the shark for clues</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802715</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The stomach of the shark reveals its travels.&lt;/b&gt; Glittering corals, exotic scales, and characteristic fish bones - your doctors finish their inspection of the shark's entrails and confirm your destination: to the Southern coral barriers! When the ship reaches the correct latitude, several islands litter the horizon. The crew hesitates to come any closer. The water is shallower than usual, and filled with sharp coral reefs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802718</GUID><Text>Navigate closer to the islands and their reefs</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802720</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your ship avoids the deadly reefs and finds the castaways!&lt;/b&gt; The vessel groans as it swims through the clear waters, the deepest corals reflecting its shadow as it narrowly avoids them. It takes a short while to find the castaways, entrenched among the dunes of a secluded beach, sprouting from it with squeals of joy and disbelief. Their captain offers his unalienable loyalty, and your crew gladly welcomes the newcomers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802721</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ship cannot pass the underwater barrier.&lt;/b&gt; Despite your navigator's efforts, the ship bumps against the coral reef - the manoeuvre is too complex and too risky for her. The crew are forced to turn their backs on the paradisiacal islands. Whether the castaways were real, and whether they were indeed stranded here, they will never know.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802719</GUID><Text>Stay away and have the look-out search for castaways</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802722</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Found them!&lt;/b&gt; Your look-out shows their brilliance when they spot the thin smoke line of a campfire in the distance. A dinghy is sent to retrieve the castaways, and comes back filled to the brim with men with overgrown beards, torn clothes, and awed expressions. Their captain pledges himself to your crew. Once shaved and washed, the castaways prove themselves to be excellent sailors - and even better companions.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802723</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The look-out draws a blank.&lt;/b&gt; Scanning the islands from afar is a difficult exercise, made even harder by the lack of experience. The crew soon realises that it will never find anyone from such a distance. Reluctant to risk the ship's integrity over the mere possibility of the castaways' existence, your sailors choose to leave and forget.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802724</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The homemade autopsy is a mess.&lt;/b&gt; The shark's entrails are cut along with their contents, and spilled over the deck is a nauseous mass of gore and artefacts of unknown origin. The doctor cannot make sense of the anarchy he's created.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802725</GUID><Text>Interpret the patterns in the shark's entrails</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802727</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Relentless faith guides the most deserving.&lt;/b&gt; In the spilled guts of the shark, your navigators see the shapes of islands, your doctors see the patterns of life forms, and your boatswain sees the promise of rewards. Driven by an inner force beyond simple greed, the crew sails past coral reefs and insidious currents, and finds the island on which the castaways had been waiting for rescue. Their relief is glorious, and their captain promises to serve your crew!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802728</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There is nothing to find but deceit.&lt;/b&gt; Your cooper burns some sage among the remains of the shark, and sniffs the lumpy smoke. If forces do talk to him, they might have been beyond what he could handle: he suddenly pounces on the closest sailor, crushing her throat between his hands. Three more fall before his frenzy drives him overboard with an otherworldly scream. The castaways are cursed, and the sailors mourn their comrades for the rest of the trip.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802726</GUID><Text>Divination? Let's just stop now</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802729</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Shark, bottle and messages are thrown overboard.&lt;/b&gt; Several sailors protest against the rash decision - they'd have preferred to exhaust all options before giving up, or at least kept the messages to share them at the next harbour. The imagined blame and grief of the castaways haunts them for a while.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802713</GUID><Text>Map the islands matching the partial coordinates</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802730</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The search defines a specific area.&lt;/b&gt; Many islands match the latitude, but far fewer could be mapped on an actual shipping route. By deducing where the castaways' ship might have gone, your navigators identify a handful of islands which could host the castaways. After two weeks of smooth sailing, your ship reaches the area: a necklace of islands linked by strands of deadly coral reef.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802731</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your navigator is overwhelmed by the mass of possibilities.&lt;/b&gt; Unable to agree on a proper searching method, yet alone define a list of reasonable possibilities, they abandon their task and admit the crew might as well try to work out the contents of the entrails. It's said as a joke, however, some sailors consider the idea.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802714</GUID><Text>There's no time to spare for such things</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802732</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The bottle and its messages are thrown back into the sea.&lt;/b&gt; The crew's regrets drift away with the bottle, and the castaways are soon forgotten.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802734</GUID><Text>The Mad Preacher</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802735</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your chaplain is going overboard with his preaching.&lt;/b&gt; Blaming the expedition's mishaps and misfortunes on the supposed heresy of the ship's officers, the man of faith manages to rouse the gradual distrust and anger of the sailors. His preaching is now part of the crew's daily routine. His words find an echo in the mouths of the sailors, and your lieutenants can see their authority slipping away.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802736</GUID><Text>Demonstrate that his doubts are fuelled by a mental illness</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802739</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The man of faith belongs in an asylum.&lt;/b&gt; Your doctor interrupts the chaplain's daily sermon and accuses him of megalomania, listing the traits of the madness: desire for attention, a craving for control, and an overwhelming urge to rouse the paranoia of others in order to match one's own. The portrait is a perfect depiction of the chaplain, and, despite their former affection for the man, the sailors agree that he should be sedated with laudanum for the rest of the trip.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802740</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor only proves his own paranoia.&lt;/b&gt; Your doctor interrupts the chaplain's daily sermon with a loud declaration, stating that the man of faith is, in fact, a soul tormented by a mental illness. With all eyes on him, your doctor utters a list of personal opinions rather than medical facts, and the chaplain welcomes his doubts with benevolence. His influence flourishes, and your lieutenants have to make do with him for the rest of the trip.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802737</GUID><Text>Discredit him in a direct confrontation</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802741</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat has a greater way with words.&lt;/b&gt; She silently enters the lower deck during the chaplain's daily preaching, and waits in a corner of a room. When the man of faith finally loses his nerve and asks her what she wants, she lists two hours worth of the chaplain's arguments and, without pause, offers counterpoints for each of them. The humiliation is magnificent, and the chaplain's babbling defence convinces the crew of his puerility. They lose interest.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802742</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat was not ready to face the chaplain.&lt;/b&gt; She confronts the preacher before the crew, and flaunts her interpretation of the chaplain's mistakes, stating how wrong he is without taking into account the weeks of argument he'd built with his followers. Her diatribe convinces none but herself, and the chaplain simply remarks that her anger is proof of his being right. Your lieutenants have to make do with his whims for the rest of the trip.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802738</GUID><Text>Simply punish him, without taking measures against his ideas</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802743</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Not the most diplomatic solution, but it works.&lt;/b&gt; Trusted sailors interrupt the chaplain during his daily preaching and drag him to the upper deck, where your first mate welcomes the man of faith with a devoted flogging. The display of violence mostly proves the preacher's point, but the menace of the officers' ire is greater than the crew's distrust in them. The trip resumes in a climate of tension.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802799</GUID><Text>The Night In Jail</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802800</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Behind bars!&lt;/b&gt; The prolonged stay of your ship in this harbour is not what you intended. Obscure laws were breached, and your whole crew has found themselves arrested under the pretence that the region's borders, whose nature remains unknown, were not respected. Heavily armed foreigners lead your crew through the sinuous roads of their city and into the local jail; after passing by a row of freshly hanged criminals, the sailors are locked up. Only two guards keep watch, their heads bobbing with fatigue. Are they underestimating your crew?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802801</GUID><Text>Poison the guards!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802804</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Just two guards is not enough to contain your science.&lt;/b&gt; The doctor brings out a sachet of vials and packets, and produces leathery pouches filled with white powders, some matte, some glittering like sugar. He mixes a bit of this one and a bit of that one, gauging measures with the eye of the seasoned practitioner, then calls to the guards. When the unsuspecting wardens are close enough, the doctor blows the mixture in their face. The men drop dead!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802806</GUID><Text>Disguise yourselves as guards and escort the rest of the crew</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802808</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The escape is flawless.&lt;/b&gt; Two of your sailors don the guards' uniforms and drag the rest of the chained crew through the prison. When they are stopped at the exit, they mimic the local accent, briefly explain the liberation, and kick one of the chained sailors for good measure. The legitimate wardens buy the lie! It takes an even greater effort to refrain from laughing before reaching the ship and leaving the port.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802809</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An attempt way beyond their ability.&lt;/b&gt; Two sailors put on the guards' uniforms and lead the crew through the prison, until some legitimate guards stop them and enquire about the strange cortège. The disguised men's fidgety attitude and suspiciously foreign accent is enough to convince the wardens to check their original cell: the guards' bodies are found, and with them comes the heavy charge of murder. The following day, the trial is held.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802812</GUID><Text>Offer to pay a fine, however high it might be</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802814</GUID><Text>The judges give your captain a stern look</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802815</GUID><Text>Confirm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802817</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The price is high, but fair.&lt;/b&gt; Most of the expedition's budget is squandered in the brutal fine, and though the crew are cleared of their charges, they find themselves forced to ration their supplies for the rest of the trip. The doctor and his accursed ideas are blamed, and the man is turned into a scapegoat: his rations are regularly stolen, damaging his health and abilities - and, worse, the crew blatantly avoid his treatments.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802816</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802818</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Who would accept such a meager payment?&lt;/b&gt; Murder is not a subject to be triffled with, and the foreign court makes its opinion clear: your crew will pay in the hardest way possible. To show they value life more than your sailors, the judges impose a non-lethal punishment, devising a program of forced labour and precise observation to ensure the sailors suffer as much as possible without dying. Months of hell follow before the crew can leave.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802813</GUID><Text>Plead that they were just following orders, and have the crew repudiate Her Majesty</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802819</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;That lie is believable, but it doesn't erase your crew's crimes.&lt;/b&gt; The foreign judges put aside any idea of the death sentence, and focus instead on finding a punishment befitting the crime. The crew are arranged into a procession, and made to cross the city in chains while chanting the ill-will of their Queen. Their patriotism tainted, the sailors never dare to speak her name again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802820</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Who would believe such an obvious lie?&lt;/b&gt; Why would their Queen ask for such a menial task as poisoning overseas guards? To match the crime, the crew's lieutenants are forced to drink hemlock solutions, before being trapped in a single cell with the rest of the crew. The lieutenants gag and wheeze for days in agony, their skin puffing and their muscles stiffening in impossible positions, until their breathing itself is locked into place. Only then are the sailors allowed to leave.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802807</GUID><Text>Avoid drawing any attention and sneak outside</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802821</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The perfect crime!&lt;/b&gt; Despite their numbers, your sailors manage to sneak through the prison and into the streets, where they become shadows under the moonless night. Led by your most competent hunters, they creep through the back alleys and back yards, until their obscurity returns them to their ship. Feeling like the protagonists of an adventure novel, and revelling in the sentiment, they leave the harbour in the gliding vessel - all lights off, and no sound made.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802822</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They are caught!&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors' lack of discretion is awkward, and it's only a matter of minutes before a patrol spots them. Without any prepared disguise or lie, they're instantly arrested - and worse, the bodies of the poisoned guards are found on the way back to their cell. The next morning, they're judged not just for their meager trespassing, but for actual murder.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802805</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor showcases his ignorance.&lt;/b&gt; He produces a pouch of arsenic before calling the guards. When the jailers are close enough, the doctor is ready to blow the powder in their face - however, his lack of knowledge of the poison's properties backfires. The soft inhalation of the doctor is enough to bring the highly volatile poison to his lips, and he leaps back, coughing and wheezing. The guards immediately understand this was attempted murder.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802802</GUID><Text>Dig an escape tunnel!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802823</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A nice display of craftsmanship.&lt;/b&gt; The crew digs a tunnel with skill, taking care to reinforce the structure and analyse the soil's nature as they progress. They avoid the most friable sections of the city's ground and emerge on the coast, exactly as calculated. Your ship's not too far, but a frigate stands guard. However, its lights are off, and the guards onboard might be sleeping rather than actually keeping watch.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802827</GUID><Text>Stealthily sail away</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802829</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Swift as a whisper.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors embark on the ship and deploy its sails in an excruciatingly slow manner, timing their flapping and clinking with the melody of the backwash. The vessel creaks softly and lets the sea take it, drifting away from the harbour with delicate movements of to and fro. Soon, the city is but a point on the horizon, and the sailors allow themselves to explode in a clamour of celebration.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802831</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Ridiculously visible.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors tiptoe past the guarding frigate with their shadows stretching across the whole deck, their stressed whispers ringing through the night. As a testimony to their poor hunting skill, it takes a barrel in their cheeks for them to realize they have been spotted. The next morning, the judges' verdict takes into account the escape attempt and condemns half of your crew to a month of forced labour.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802832</GUID><Text>Offer to pay a fine instead</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802834</GUID><Text>The judges give your captain a stern look</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802835</GUID><Text>Confirm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802837</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Bribery is a reasonable option.&lt;/b&gt; The payment offered satisfies the judges, who agree to let your sailors go. The crew mutter about the absurd trial and its even more absurd resolution, but their relief shows.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802836</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802838</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Not enough.&lt;/b&gt; The judges scoff at your attempt to bribe them with a so-called fine, and advise your crew to try a higher amount next time. To show they're not so cheap, they extend your crew's penalty to two months of forced labour, and place the sailors under the tightest surveillance. The two months are a mixture of menial and unrewarding tasks, and frequent and unwarranted whipping.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802833</GUID><Text>Force your crew into complying with the unreasonable demand</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802839</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew comply.&lt;/b&gt; Following their superiors' orders, the sailors accept the judges' penalty and fulfil their obligations to the best of their abilities. One month of forced labour seems harsh, though, even for the local population, who supports the crew's effort and vouch for their liberation. The crew earn an early release, and are left tired but touched by the unexpected appreciation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802840</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew refuse to comply.&lt;/b&gt; The insistence of your first mate cannot convince the sailors to sacrifice themselves for the good of the crew, and the heated debate that follows is cut short by the judges. If your crew cannot decide who to send into forced labour, all of them will go! Forced to submit, the crew invest their strength into one month of meaningless tasks and incessant bickering among themselves.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802828</GUID><Text>Bombard the frigate as you leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802841</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An explosive escape!&lt;/b&gt; The crew feels whole again aboard their ship, and they now have the tools to face their opponents. The loaded canons fire a volley of precise blasts at the foreign frigate and its harbour, setting the whole coast aflame. Your ship sails away with the blaze in its back, a vision of grandiose might which fills the sailors with pride.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802842</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A failed attempt.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors lack the skills required to load their cannons under the cover of night. Misguided movements and poor knowledge of the armament makes the canons overflow with powder. When they're fired, the weapons explode and take their gunner with them, offering a loud indication of the escapees' position. The crew are seized and sent back to their cell. At dawn, the judges sentence half the crew to a month of forced labour.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802825</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A dead end.&lt;/b&gt; The crew can handle basic digging, but their progress is reluctant, slowed by the constant fear of being buried in the makeshift tunnel. At the first obstacle they encounter - a large foundation pillar which blocks the way - the sailors hurriedly agree that there is nothing more that can be done with the tunnel. They return to their cell, relieved.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802826</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Buried alive.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors have but a vague idea of how to dig an escape tunnel. They grind the earth with their bare hands, the pungent soil getting stuck under their nails and lining their clothes, hair, skin. As air comes to lack, so too does their judgement, and the crew push forward, blind to the crumbling rock. The tunnel collapses in on them, and what few sailors were still outside are judged and released without sentence - the death of their companions is deemed punishment enough.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802803</GUID><Text>Prepare your defence for the upcoming trial</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802844</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An epic trial!&lt;/b&gt; At their first chance to speak, your crew engage in an extensive and thrilling retelling of their adventures, captivating the audience and the judges. They climb and rock benches to mimic past naval battles, engage the public by asking them timely and suspenseful questions, and modify their tales according to the audience's whims. Their trespassing is made part of the story, and as they retell the trial itself, the judges insist on letting them go. They leave as heroes!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802849</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your defence doesn't move the judges.&lt;/b&gt; The trial follows obscure local laws, and their meandering unravelling goes beyond what your diplomat is used to. Her words stumble upon the judges' traps, and her lack of understanding of the legal subtleties of the situation is obvious to anyone. To the dismay of your crew, the judges' verdict is harsh: one month of public labour for at least half of your sailors.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802851</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat is beyond awkward.&lt;/b&gt; At the trial, she interrupts the judges to insist on meaningless details, pointing out not your crew's innocence, but rather the reasons why their guilt is, to quote her directly, "not that bad". Her lack of professionalism and conviction is irritating, and the judges interrupt the hearing with a hasty judgement just to stop her. Your crew are coerced into one full month of forced labour, a disproportionate and disheartening sentence.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802900</GUID><Text>The Frozen Chasm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802901</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crevasse swallowed your sailors.&lt;/b&gt; Attempting to cross the mountain pass was a risk, and your crew paid the price for their desire to test the odds. The rocky path turned to frozen snow, then to the still body of a glacier, its ominous presence plaguing the air with the smell of winter. Night swelled faster than anticipated, and it didn't take long for the less cautious explorers to discover the frailty of ice mantles.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802902</GUID><Text>Build a snow anchor to descend into the crevasse</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802905</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The snow anchor is a reliable solution.&lt;/b&gt; Your explorers rope themselves together, passing a safety line of sturdy hemp around their waists, through the mounds of packed snow, and into the hands of selected athletes. They control the rope as the rescue team expertly climbs down. The fallen sailors are in poor condition, and the feeble light and jagged walls do not hint at an easy rescue.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802907</GUID><Text>Bind their broken limbs with splints and help them climb</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802909</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The best course of action for a most hazardous situation.&lt;/b&gt; The splints are not only immobilizing the wounded limbs of the fallen sailors, they're supporting them too, and with the help of their rescuers, they manage to climb to a high enough portion of the ice wall for the others to pull them up. Even the wounded, despite their shaking bodies and frozen injuries, find the strength to join the following cheer.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802910</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The splints are torture devices.&lt;/b&gt; The splints are well assembled, but the sailors' lack of anatomical knowledge sees them simply binding the splints "wherever", as the wooden aids force the wounded into unnatural movements and postures. When the men are finally pulled up, they're in even more of a dire state than after their fall.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802908</GUID><Text>Bind the wounded to the safety rope and pull them up</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802913</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The men are brought to safety!&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors bind the wounded with a clever construction of marine knots, providing support to the fallen sailors while spreading their weight across the safety rope. Pulling them up is so easy, the injured can even spare a laugh while swinging across the ice wall. The successful teamwork has brought your sailors closer together than ever, and it's a group of brothers and sisters which brings the wounded back to the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802914</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;This will never work.&lt;/b&gt; The wounded are bound to the safety rope in the roughest way possible, their injuries pressed against the coarse hemp till the fibres are coloured red. Despite the need to leave quickly, there's no way the men can be pulled up without worsening their state. Your sailors need help. Will the crew still on the ship notice their prolonged absence?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802915</GUID><Text>Send scouts in the night to find help</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802917</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Help at last.&lt;/b&gt; Your scouts navigate the night-filled glacier with care, marking their route with etchings in the ice. They bring back sailors and an actual pulley, allowing them to rescue the wounded without causing any more harm. The injured men are in a poor state, and will probably suffer from this trial in the long term, but for now they simply savour their survival.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802918</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The rescue team also faces the trials of the glacier.&lt;/b&gt; Of the two scouts sent, only one comes back, and with him a team of sailors frozen by their numerous detours and hours spent getting lost in the mountain. The pulley they bring is the perfect solution for rescuing the fallen men. The wounded are many, both among the victims and their rescuers, yet none complain: they are alive, if missing a limb or two.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802916</GUID><Text>Camp and hunt for food while waiting for rescue</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802919</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Sufficient supplies are found.&lt;/b&gt; Your hunters are much better at crafting snares than rescue harnesses, and they gather game on a regular enough basis that the team can survive until help finally arrives. The diet of bony rabbits wasn't enough to keep your sailors in perfect health, but a couple weeks of care and proper food should put them back on their feet.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802920</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The rescue team finds their comrades famished and wasted.&lt;/b&gt; Your hunters couldn't find sufficient game in the unforgiving mountain, and the diet of molten ice aggravated the wounded's condition past what they could humanely endure. The sailors stagger back to the ship, leaving two dead behind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802906</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The snow anchor fails your sailors terribly.&lt;/b&gt; For most of your crew, a snow anchor is but a vague concept. The rescuers bind themselves to a frail heap of packed snow, and descend into the crevasse one by one. One, two, three men slide along the walls of ice, their weight pulling on the cracking anchor. When the fourth jumps into the rift, the anchor falls with him, and with it the very edge of the ice - burying the crevasse and sealing it forever.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802903</GUID><Text>Look for another way into the crevasse</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802921</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A way in!&lt;/b&gt; Following the glacier and identifying its contours by the bumps and gaps of its snow cape, your sailors find a spot of crunchy and brittle ice which covers the entrance of a steep slope leading into the crevasse. The wounded men lie at the bottom, doing their best to muffle their whimpers of pain.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802926</GUID><Text>Carry the wounded up the slope</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802930</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Up they go!&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors are athletes of great physical condition, and the wounded are no exception. They clench their teeth as they're pulled onto their companions' backs and carried up the tricky slope, helping their rescuers by balancing their movements and ignoring their gnawing pain. The morning greets them in a glorious scene of dumbfounded relief.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802931</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It works, but at what cost?&lt;/b&gt; The wounded are pulled more than they are carried, their rescuers lacking both the physical and mental strength required to treat the injured with the care and delicacy they need. When the last man is pulled from the slope, a gruesome noise announces that parts of him have decided to stay in the tunnel. The body is abandoned as the crew hurries back to the ship, disgruntled.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802922</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An alternate entrance is found after a long while.&lt;/b&gt; Alternate is a euphemism: the sailors went deep into the entrails of the glacier, and instead of finding a way into the crevasse, they discerned a fault in the thin ice wall. Breaking it allowed them inside, but their delayed arrival, rather than soothing the fallen men, instead triggers their ire: couldn't they have come faster? Don't they see their freezing limbs? Don't they know the fright they caused?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802932</GUID><Text>Alleviate their panic with drugs</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802934</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The groggy men are cooperating at last.&lt;/b&gt; A just dosage of tranquillisers tones down their panic while keeping them conscious, and the wounded let themselves be guided out of the crevasse and back to the ship. When the drugs and the cold wear off, they realise how oblivious they were to the real extent of their injuries.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802935</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Their artificial calm lasts eternally.&lt;/b&gt; The dosage of tranquillisers is a bit on the nose, and doesn't even take into account the weakened state of the patients. Their panic calms down at an alarming speed, and their consciousness lapses, followed by a sleep so deep it takes away both their breath, and their heartbeat. At least they died peacefully.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802933</GUID><Text>Talk them into a calmer behaviour</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802936</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They calm down and can finally be rescued.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors are respectful of the wounded's pain and sympathise with them, soothing their angst with empathy and welcomed admiration. The injured stifle their insults and try to live to their companions' expectations, holding their whimpers until they're back on the ship. Their wounds are a nasty sight, but their pride is beaming.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802937</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Their panic soars, pushing them to their death.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors try to motivate the wounded through accurate descriptions of their fate, pointing at their darkened limbs and prophesying their coming fall. The injured enter a state of pure terror, screaming continuously and unable to hear themselves, crawling away from the news bearers and deeper into the chasm, until the snow dampens their screams and the sound of their final fall.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802923</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The glacier forbids your sailors from finding their way through it.&lt;/b&gt; The twisting paths of the frozen structure are too much for the crew, who encountered enough trouble following the main marked glacier route. They're forced to abandon their quest, and must instead go back to the broken mantle and its crevasse. The cold steadily bites and weakens them, and they soon take the same purple tint as the men they are trying to save.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802938</GUID><Text>Have the weakened sailors try to pull the others up</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802940</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors' best efforts cannot compensate for the loss of time.&lt;/b&gt; The crew's physical ability is excellent, but the cold makes no exceptions when it comes to eating flesh. The wounded are pulled up, and the fangs of ice tear their feet and legs away, the crevasse keeping the trophies as fees for the men's freedom. They're brought back to the ship, but can never truly take part in the expedition again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802941</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A terrible initiative.&lt;/b&gt; Several sailors slip into the crevasse, pushing and pulling the wounded up the frozen walls at the cost of what little energy they have. Their panting draws lines of mist around them, and their faint clouds of breath thicken, and thicken, and suddenly evaporate. There is no more saving to be done for the injured and their rescuers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802939</GUID><Text>Put the wounded out of their misery before leaving</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802942</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Heartbreaking.&lt;/b&gt; Could they have resolved this in any other way? Your sailors try to ignore the question while they point their guns at their companions, men too frozen now to realize what's about to happen. They die silently, and the absence of protest weighs heavier than any voiced reproach on the would-be rescuers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802904</GUID><Text>Leave the dolts behind</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802943</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They had it coming.&lt;/b&gt; This is not your crew's first encounter with the dangers of the wild, yet they persisted in being foolhardy and ignored the basic rules of mountain hiking. Let their fate be a lesson for the other idiots.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803044</GUID><Text>Afraid of the Light</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803045</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;This man is severely ill!&lt;/b&gt; A group of sailors bang on the door to the doctor's cabin. They carry a feverish friend, who between two moments of altered sleep mutters about a burning radiance and closes his eyes to protect himself from the deck's half-light. The doctor's inspection could reveal more symptoms, but shouldn't the crazed patient be secluded instead?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803046</GUID><Text>Inspect the man at the risk of contamination</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803048</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The symptoms speak for themselves.&lt;/b&gt; The man's neck is stiff, his breathing distraught, his cheeks paralysed. As the doctor explains to the rest of the crew the details of meningitis, the lying patient suddenly trembles, taken by a seizure of such intensity that his whole body arches upwards, bent in a pyramidal pose of impossible tension. He screams out the name of your doctor before falling down, dead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803050</GUID><Text>This was the delirium of a dying man</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803055</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There is no truth but the voice of science.&lt;/b&gt; The accusation was the plea of a sick fool. Your doctor knows what ravages meningitis can do to the mind of its victims, and his collected account of symptoms convinces your crew of your doctor's innocence and acute knowledge. He is free to inspect the men on board, and identifies several others who carry the symptoms. The sick are promptly isolated and disembarked at the next harbour, and your expedition emerges unscathed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803056</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor's truth isn't convincing.&lt;/b&gt; He fumbles through his explanations, as his limited knowledge of the dead man's illness begins to show. Even if the doctor did seem to correctly identify the ailment, he fails to justify the impressive death the crew just witnessed. Doubts linger as the expedition goes on, and the doctor spends the rest of trip isolated in a quarantine of defiance and distrust.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803051</GUID><Text>This was the accusation of a victim</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803057</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Heavenly truths hide in the last wishes of a man.&lt;/b&gt; The doctor is pressed for answers and asked to swear his innocence before the Lord: a feat too great, and a lie to heavy for him to bear. He confesses to having poisoned the sailor with mercury over a dispute of faith against facts - ironically, the doctor's own fear of the Light made him confess his sins. He is hanged, and your crew find relief in the punishment of the murderer.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803058</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Isn't this judgement too hasty?&lt;/b&gt; The doctor is immediately accused of having murdered the sick sailor, but he isn't enough of a believer to confess before the cross. He is nevertheless hanged for his supposed crimes. Relief tints the mood of your crew, but many know the punishment was hasty and unjust.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803049</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your doctor is at a loss.&lt;/b&gt; Fear of the light sounds like an ailment belonging to the realm of the Lord, and the man of science is too blinded by his fright to notice the change in his patient. In a fit of unforeseen anger, the sick man leaps on his healer and attempts to claw his eyes out, before being restrained by the surrounding sailors. What madness is this?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803059</GUID><Text>Observe the evolution of the lunatic's symptoms</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803061</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Rabies, no doubt - confine him!&lt;/b&gt; The man's unnatural fury keeps growing under the observation of the doctor, who finally discerns familiar patterns in his patient's behaviour. His massive salivation and rejection of any form of drink leaves little room for doubt: he has rabies. The sailors confine him into the hold without remorse, and wait for the illness to steal his life.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803062</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The symptoms culminate in death.&lt;/b&gt; The roped patient wriggles, drooling, screeching and screaming for the lights to be gone, until a seizure of astonishing magnitude takes him, leaving his cadaver frozen in an impossible position. The doctor realises, far too late, that he might have been facing a case of rabies. Around him, the crew grow restless: what if this failure of a scientist was still wrong?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803063</GUID><Text>Find evidence on the dead man's body</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803065</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The flesh carries proof.&lt;/b&gt; In the thigh of the dead man, your doctor discerns burn marks unlike any other, appended over a festering wound. This is the work of a priest, who applied a heated key of Saint Hubert over the bite of a rabid dog - in the hope, visibly misplaced, that the Saint would cure the ailment. The sailor had known of his fate, but chose to endanger his companions regardless. He deserved death.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803066</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew has had enough of the doctor's incapability.&lt;/b&gt; The man of science probes the body, tearing its clothes to reveal bruised skin and vulnerable flesh - a sight which convinces the sailors that they have seen the boundaries of his skill. The doctor is seized and roped alongside the cadaver he was desecrating, being left to ponder his calling in the depths of the hull. At the next harbour, your crew grimly realise that the doctor's wrinkled mass will never do harm nor good again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803064</GUID><Text>Find evidence in the dead man's belongings</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803067</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Undisputable evidence points to a grim story.&lt;/b&gt; The inspection of the dead man's belongings lands no result, but your sailors know better than to consider this failure as final. They extend their search to his sleeping quarters, and within the loose planks of an amateurish repair, they find their proof: a key of Saint Hubert, a vital artefact for any believer suspecting the menace of rabies. The sailor knew of his ailment and chose to hide it. This truth pains your crew, but the closure brings relief.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803068</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No proof, no trust.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors are no good at sleuthing, especially under pressure, and they find no proof pointing to the nature of the dead man's illness. Suspicion rises as the doctor orders the immediate burial at sea of the cadaver. Long after the cloth-wrapped body was thrown into the sea, the cadaver of the dead man is found hidden in the hull. There is little doubt as to who was thrown overboard in its place.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803060</GUID><Text>Confine the madman in the hold</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803069</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors will have nothing to do with this lunacy.&lt;/b&gt; Sending the sick man to the depths of the hold is a cruel choice, but it lowers the risk of any otherworldly contamination. His howls bedevil the ship until his voice becomes whisper, then silence. His body is buried at sea in a hurried parody of ceremony, as the sailors avoid discussing his unknown illness.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803047</GUID><Text>Put the fool in quarantine</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803070</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sick die alone.&lt;/b&gt; Afraid of the man's state and the contagion he could potentially spread, your sailors lock him up in an empty cabin. He offers no resistance, and during the following days, his presence is reduced to sporadic whimpers and the occasional monologue. When the voice finally dies out, the sailors carefully wrap his body in cloth and bury him at sea, both relieved and sorry that they let him die a dog's death.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803072</GUID><Text>Ghosts in the Ice</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803115</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A ship trapped in the floe!&lt;/b&gt; While navigating the treacherous Northern seas, your expedition happens upon frozen waters, whose masses spread over the horizon and plant their roots deep below the surface. Their dominion has imprisoned a ship much like yours. Skin parched, voice torn, eyes buried deep in their skulls, the stranded sailors sacrifice their last bits of strength to beg for help.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803074</GUID><Text>Diagnose the sailors' condition</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803080</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Scurvy.&lt;/b&gt; While inspecting the mouths of the stranded sailors, your doctor's fingers go straight through their gums as if they were made of paper, and the teeth below quit their lodging with a shake and a pull. The ill men admit to having already buried two of their own at sea. More will follow if they do not eat fresh food soon.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803082</GUID><Text>Part with a large portion of your supplies</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803084</GUID><Text>The starved sailors eye your food with envy</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803085</GUID><Text>Confirm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803087</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your loss will help their survival, no doubt.&lt;/b&gt; The donated supplies are enough for the strangers to hold out until rescue comes. Your crew promises to look for the nearest harbour and call for help there - a promise which they are likely to keep, forced as they will be to resupply in order to avoid their own starvation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803086</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803088</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There are not enough supplies for both your crew and theirs.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors stop rummaging through their cargo, and must deny the stranded men their hope of renewed supplies. The poor souls are too weak to vent their anger, but their empty looks and cursing whispers follow your crew long after the ghost ship has been swallowed by the horizon.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803083</GUID><Text>Hunt the floe for fresh meat</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803089</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The icy domain gives a profuse bounty.&lt;/b&gt; Your fishermen forsake the idea of exploring the floe, knowing that the local game hides underwater. Adapting to the hostile environment, they catch enough seals to feed the whole crew, and the feast, even if it doesn't miraculously heal the sick, seems to at least replenish their spirit. They encourage your crew to use your ship's cannons to break the ice encasing their ship - despite the risk of damaging their hull.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803092</GUID><Text>Blast the floe apart</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803094</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ship is freed!&lt;/b&gt; Your artillery men take hold of the stranded ship's cannons, ordering the crew to coordinate their frozen artillery with your ship's own firepower. The combined shots from both vessels trace the contours of the ice, breaking it with successive volleys until the floe parts and lets go, much to the appreciation of both crews. One of the sailors who helped fire the icy cannons even offers to join your voyage, having been taken in by your crew's kindness and brilliant skills.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803095</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your shots break the ice, along with their hull.&lt;/b&gt; Shooting a cannonball through an exact thickness of ice without going any further requires a degree of control that your artillery man doesn't have. The blast pierces through the floe with a resounding crack, but the splinters projected by the impact are both ice and wood. The stranded sailors are thankful for your help - and the water did cushion most of your cannonball's power - but your crew still feels guilt at seeing their ship hobble away.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803093</GUID><Text>Promise to call in help and leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803096</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew promises to send help.&lt;/b&gt; They leave the stranded men after telling them of steam-powered icebreakers and expeditions versed in the art of rescuing people such as them, and the tales seem to satisfy their angst. Your sailors hope that the next harbour will indeed provide such saviours.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803090</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hunters can't find enough food.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors manage to track, find and trap a few seals, but the bounty's not enough to feed a whole crew of ailing men. It might be enough for them to hold out until a rescue mission arrives, however - if there were less of them, or if they followed a strict rationing discipline.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803097</GUID><Text>Invite as many as you can on board</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803099</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They are desperate for help, and accept your proposal.&lt;/b&gt; Your diplomat pressures the strangers more than she reassures them, and her pragmatic approach to the problem manages to convince them. About a third of the sick embark upon your ship, whereas the remaining sailors huddle together to share the meagre food that was hunted for them. Going back and forth between the closest harbour and the trapped ship drains both your crew and your time, but the rescued men are indefinitely grateful.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803100</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat cannot convince anyone to stay behind.&lt;/b&gt; Rather than depicting the reasons behind your crew's decision, she bluntly announces the number of strangers allowed on board, and sparks an immediate frenzy. The skeletal men rise on trembling legs, their limbs pulled forward by the puppet strings of hunger, rushing into each other until most strings are cut. The culled crew climbs aboard your ship, and their soulless presence plagues the rest of the expedition.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803098</GUID><Text>Order and enforce strict rationing</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803101</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The system is strict, but it allows them to hold their ground.&lt;/b&gt; One of your officers, and two of your biggest, most impressive sailors go down below deck on the stranded ship to distribute food portions, and teach the men about the merits and secrets of disciplined rationing. The crew nod their understanding, silent as your ship sails away. Hopefully they will follow your advice, and most will still be alive when a rescue ship comes to their aid.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803102</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your frail discipline falls apart.&lt;/b&gt; One of your officers and a handful of escorting sailors order the starved men to ration the meat, lest they suffer from even more famine while your ship goes to look for help. Their lack of presence and conviction has no impact on the sailors, who throw themselves on the supplies and transform into beasts; frail animals who lack the strength to rip each other apart despite their will to do so. Your ship leaves in a hurry, leaving the fools to their madness.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803091</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The floe is barren.&lt;/b&gt; Unable to catch any game on the frozen ice and the surrounding hills of snow, despite the numerous tracks sprinkling the area, your hunters come back empty-handed and ashamed. The stranded sailors appreciate the effort, but their eyes grow duller still. They're still desperate for any kind of help.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803081</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The unknown illness might attack your crew.&lt;/b&gt; Your doctor cannot pierce the mystery of the strangers' ailment: their ghost-like bodies fascinate as much as they terrify. Too scared to properly inspect their cadaverous skin, he hurriedly affirms that any sort of prolonged contact with them would put your own sailors in danger. Your ship whisks your crew away from the imaginary threat, leaving the strangers to die.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803077</GUID><Text>Break the floe with your cannons</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803103</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A job carried out with few hitches.&lt;/b&gt; Making sure that they don't damage the ship itself, your sailors fire cannonball after cannonball, taking the time to appraise and readjust their aim with each new shot. The ship's hull is grazed by the first shots, and soon the floe parts before the vessel, the ice blocks gliding against each other with menacing cracks. The trapped crew profusely thank yours! Your sailors revel in their selfless act, trying to ignore the emaciated faces and feeble voices.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803104</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A reckless failure.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors have no notion of subtlety, and even less understanding of their own firepower. The very first cannonball crashes straight through the ice, shooting beneath the waves and into the trapped hull below. Frozen foam explodes and stains the floe with streaks of grey, which all point at the gaping hole in the wooden frame. The stranded crew tremble back and forth to secure the leak, and refuse any more help.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803105</GUID><Text>Share supplies as an apology</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803107</GUID><Text>Can we spare enough supplies for them?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803108</GUID><Text>Confirm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803110</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The best that could have been done.&lt;/b&gt; The strangers accept your sailors' offer with reluctance, eyeing the leakage they caused more than the food that they offer. The compensation is enough to put your own crew in need of rationing, but it does not absolve their mistakes. Your ship leaves with promises to call for help at the next harbour, eager to leave the judging stares.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803109</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803111</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The situation turns as bad as it could get.&lt;/b&gt; Enraged by your retraction, the stranded crew flings resounding insults at your crew, followed by splinters from the broken hull, then the crates they'd prepared to store your offering, and finally, actual men. Fuelled by their ire and moving despite their cadaverous state, the assailants fire at will, oblivious to the retort of your crew. When the wraiths finally give in to death, your officers start to count the bodies.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803106</GUID><Text>They can take care of themselves, leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803112</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew leave the stranded men to fend for themselves.&lt;/b&gt; There's no mistaking the leak for a negligible issue: if the skeletal state of the sailors is any indication, they'll never have the strength to fix their ship. Allowing them to keep their pride might have been the granting of a last wish.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803078</GUID><Text>Ignore their plea and leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803113</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The strangers are left to their grim fate.&lt;/b&gt; One of your sailors crystallises your crew's fears by signing himself as the trapped ship disappears into the distance. The wraiths onboard were so close to death, they had already taken its guise.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803363</GUID><Text>The Great Sickness</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803364</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A local girl is dead, of smallpox;&lt;/b&gt; a disease your expedition has without doubt brought to these shores. As her mother weeps over her limp and hive-speckled body, it seems inevitable that the contagion will take more lives. "Perhaps we can vaccinate?" says the Captain, "at the very least we can recommend precautions to prevent the disease spreading."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803365</GUID><Text>Have the ship's doctor produce a vaccine</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803366</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Such a well-prepared vaccination programme will cost...&lt;/b&gt; Your expert doctor adapts an effective preparation in the circumstances, using up a fair quantity of the ship's medical supplies in the process. One of the officers wonders if you shouldn't receive something back for all this charity...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803368</GUID><Text>Sell the locals your vaccine</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803388</GUID><Text>You can choose to sell your vaccine to the locals</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803369</GUID><Text>Accept trade</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803370</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The locals see no other choice but to accept&lt;/b&gt;— anything to prevent the epidemic your doctors have so gravely forecast.

After all, it was they who brought the sickness to this place!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803371</GUID><Text>Refuse trade</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803372</GUID><Text>Offer vaccination for free</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803373</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You recruit an aspiring doctor!&lt;/b&gt; With little debate, the locals agree to receive the vaccinations against smallpox, probably saving their lives in the process. It is perhaps a side-effect of the openness and apparent selflessness with which your own medics go about the task, that a local doctor is inspired to join your expedition.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803374</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor falls sick.&lt;/b&gt; You can only assume the attempted vaccine has failed the locals also, because two weeks into the onward journey, its creator is in the grip of smallpox. Once the disease sets in there is no cure, unless you choose to trust the poor doctor's survival to God.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803375</GUID><Text>God will help where medicine cannot</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803376</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A brave few serve as guardian angels,&lt;/b&gt; praying, washing, comforting the doctor. The acrid smell of the pustules, so particular to smallpox, is soon masked by haloes of incense. After several weeks the doctor's fever goes down and the rashes become less pronounced. While no miracle— the skin will forever bear the scars— it does mean the doctor's survival.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803377</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Smallpox spreads with a missionary zeal.&lt;/b&gt; Following the priest's foolish suggestion that the crew all visit the doctor to offer their prayers, it is hardly a surprise when a spate of new cases are reported. Three weeks after the doctor dies, others are just beginning to experience the first agonising symptoms. Had your crew heartlessly abandoned the doctor, it would surely have been the better option.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803378</GUID><Text>Abandon the doctor</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803379</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;With regret, the doctor must be marooned.&lt;/b&gt; Men in gloves carry a stretcher up the beach beyond the tideline to a place in the shade where it seems likely the doctor will live out a few more days. "Fresh air might revive you," says one optimistically, but already the doctor has no strength to reply.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803380</GUID><Text>Try to prevent further spread</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803381</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The instructions are followed to the letter.&lt;/b&gt; The local people have never come into contact with smallpox before, but agree to adopt your measures against it. Your crew need reminding too; mouths covered when coughing, the avoidance of skin contact, and the frequent washing of hands in alcoholic solution. It is chastening that your mere presence has caused the death of that poor girl, but after two weeks without further cases, it is certainly a relief it does not appear to have spread.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803382</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your people find it impossible to get the message across.&lt;/b&gt; The locals go about their business as usual, disregarding the strictures you have tried to put in place. Sensing the coming epidemic, and as fears for the health of your own crew mount, it may be time just to leave...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803383</GUID><Text>Experiment with a vaccine</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803384</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Saved by a cow with cowpox.&lt;/b&gt; Your doctors remember that the "vacca" of vaccination means cow, and extract cowpox from the pustuled udders of a local beast. Everyone receives the injection, which due to the lack of appropriate facilities the doctor is unable to purify. Fortunately this only results in a number of outbreaks of other, much less destructive infections.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803385</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Things take a severe turn for the worse...&lt;/b&gt; Your doctors have little idea what they are doing, and their extraordinary decision to use a sample from the pustules on the poor dead girl to create their vaccine only accelerates the spread. In desperation, those still in health agree to board the expedition ship and escape while they still can.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803386</GUID><Text>Leave as quickly as you can</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803387</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Smallpox has wiped out entire civilisations.&lt;/b&gt; That is the pervading anxiety as the expedition prepares for hasty departure. The locals seem unaware of the danger, perhaps thinking the death of the young girl an isolated case. Before leaving, one of your scribes grimly documents the customs and traditions of these peoples in case it should have to serve as the sole record of their having existed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803520</GUID><Text>The Flower-Eaters</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803521</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The blue flowers have put the members of your expedition into a frightening delirium.&lt;/b&gt; Among the tranquil villages of this delta, your crew had seen the water plants — baskets 'laden with flower and fruit' — everywhere, and had been curious to try them. "You see, it does them no harm," the Captain had said encouragingly, as they made friends with some locals upon the riverbank one sleepy afternoon. But not long into the delicious feast of flowers, your expedition party are experiencing wild hallucinations!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803522</GUID><Text>Have the doctor intervene</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803523</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor chuckles.&lt;/b&gt; "Here," he says, dosing each stricken soul with a concoction from his medicine bag, "that should ease things." Soon everyone is sound asleep, and they awake the following day feeling refreshed. Unaware you've cheated, the flower-eaters are impressed! No-one normally handles their first encounter with the flower so well. &lt;b&gt;Taking it as a sign, they offer you something equally precious.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803524</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The worried doctor issues an emetic,&lt;/b&gt; "Throw it up, it's a poison!" he says. Afterwards, the crew feel extremely weak, but the effect of the drug does indeed begin to fade. "We just didn't have the guts for it," a sailor wipes his mouth. You have shown a weakness of constitution. All around, the flower-eaters share jokes at the crew's expense. &lt;b&gt;You leave humiliated.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803525</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"I have just the tonic!" your wild-eyed doctor quavers,&lt;/b&gt; pulling a bottle of Vin Mariani from his satchel. However, the mix of wine and coca leaves only serves to heighten the delirium. Some awaken from the incoherence; others don't. The flower-eaters are clearly puzzled, and offer their condolences, for no concoction so ill-advised or unfortunate has ever been seen before — or since.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803526</GUID><Text>Ask the locals what's happening</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803527</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You are somehow able to communicate that you are suffering.&lt;/b&gt; Many of the flower-eaters are seeing visions themselves — the effect they expect from consuming the plant. The locals interrupt their own lucid dreaming to help your expedition through it, realising your lack of experience in such rites of passage. The next day, your cosmic travellers feel relieved to return to the more familiar rocking of their ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803528</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your men become aggressive.&lt;/b&gt; Unable to communicate, they resort to grabbing the locals. "Drugged!" one cries, "What have you done to us?!" There is every danger this is about to turn nasty.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803529</GUID><Text>Do nothing</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803536</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The behaviour of your expedition is shameful.&lt;/b&gt; One of the flower-eaters is shoved to the ground in front of her children. When several others pile into the scrum, one of your crew, who shall go unnamed, decides to set fire to a watermill in protest. This doesn't help anyone still having hallucinations. The next morning when they awake, everyone claims not to remember a thing.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803530</GUID><Text>Command them to fight their hallucinations instead</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803531</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They battle bravely against their shadows!&lt;/b&gt; Heeding the officer's commands to resist, each of your veterans summons their inner strength to endure the sway of the little blue flower, drenched with sweat and thrusting their hands into the empty air. Eventually the horrors give way to narcosis, and a deep sleep lasting several days. This land of water lilies will take valuable time from your odyssey.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803532</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Nightmares reveal truths.&lt;/b&gt; The paranoia of their hallucinations centres on each other — a history of indiscipline and bad blood, grudges never properly settled. The drug has liberated those who feel they have been wronged. At daybreak, one of your expedition lies drowned in the river. Officially, the influence of the sinister blue flower will likely be blamed, but others are already telling a different story.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803533</GUID><Text>Let them go with the flow</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803534</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your party open their minds to visions of the divine.&lt;/b&gt; The horrors fade from view, and in their place come forest creatures, nymphs and dryads. Grand cities swirl as if formed of cloud, and golden ships voyage up to the moon.&lt;br/&gt;When the visions disappear, the crew realise they've experienced something extraordinary, and relate what they've seen to their hosts. &lt;b&gt;The flower-eaters offer a token of their appreciation&lt;/b&gt; for a shared spiritual experience.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803535</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Ahh... the intemperance of addiction.&lt;/b&gt; Although they soon grow accustomed to the devilish hallucinations, your men now develop a profane appetite for the pleasures of the flower — slumber's holy balm. Procrastination, and apathy towards the supposedly 'materialistic objectives' of the expedition are the products of these indulgences. When finally dragged away from the sleepy waters, &lt;b&gt;the crew weep bitterly, and swear to be idle&lt;/b&gt; for the remainder of their commission.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803610</GUID><Text>Sunstruck</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803611</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Vampirical injuries!?&lt;/b&gt; The path through the forest was barely visible beneath the lush vegetation. It isn't until they emerge from the pleasant shade of the trees that sunlight falls upon the crew, swelling up the skin of a few crew members with red rashes and throbbing blisters. Surely there must be a scientific explanation for their sudden photophobia...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803612</GUID><Text>Purify their skin</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803613</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The cold water soothes the burning almost immediately. &lt;/b&gt; Your expedition party enjoys a little break away from sunlight, as they gently wash the rashes off with soap in a forest pool of fresh water. The blisters are gone after a few hours and the group is ready to continue.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803614</GUID><Text>Identify the cause of their pain</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803615</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Looks like your doctor did his homework!&lt;/b&gt; "I read about something like this during my research of the hazards we could encounter in this region. They must have brushed against a giant hogweed!" The treatment is simple: enjoy a little break away from sunlight and gently wash their skin with clear cold water. The blisters are gone after a few hours, and the group is ready to continue.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803616</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor dismisses the throbbing blisters as simple mosquito bites. &lt;/b&gt; "Just try not to scratch them. If you can't help yourselves, rub them gently, that's all." But a few hours later, the vesicles have already extended throughout their entire body. They collapse, unable to take a step further, whimpering with unbearable pain.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803617</GUID><Text>Reconsider the diagnosis</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803618</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;This time, the doctor takes the symptoms seriously.&lt;/b&gt; "It looks like a chemical irritation. I wonder..." The doctor rummages through the nearby flora and in time, he finds it: a tall stem crowned by an umbrella of small white flowers. "A giant hogweed! Of course, its sap causes phototoxicity." Fortunately, the treatment is simple: a cold bath and a long break in the shade. Once they're clean, the doctor heals and bandages the lesions. But it comes many hours too late — his negligence will leave leathery red scars on the wretched few.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803619</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"It must be a rare breed of smallpox!"&lt;/b&gt; Your squeamish doctor doesn't even lean close enough to the pustules before squealing: "Stay away from them! These people are doomed, there is nothing we can do but avoid contagion!" Panic ensues, and those untouched by the rashes stampede away. The aching bunch are irresponsibly abandoned and left behind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803620</GUID><Text>Expel the vampirical curse</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803621</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A miracle!&lt;/b&gt; The priestess sinks the cursed crew members in a forest pool and blesses their foreheads with the symbol of the cross. "Exsúrgat Deus et dissipéntur inimíci ejus," she recites, and the men and women exhale a sigh of relief as the burning fades away. Although they will have to live with the devil's taint on their skin for the rest of their days, each and every one of them feels thankful and blessed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803622</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ritual is a most unholy sight. &lt;/b&gt; "Sunlight will purge your curse, bear the pain as evil oozes out of your body!" The cursed few writhe under the scorching sun as their blisters slowly morph into aberrant lumps of fluid. Everyone's beliefs are shaken before the nauseating vision. By sundown, they can barely move. It takes days for the throbbing bags of liquid to pop and peel off, leaving the hosts with bright red festering wounds. Massive scars will forever remind them of how they were forsaken by the gods.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803623</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"It must be a rare breed of smallpox!"&lt;/b&gt; Your squeamish doctor doesn't even lean close enough to the pustules before squealing: "Stay away from them! These people are doomed — there is nothing we can do but avoid contagion!" Panic ensues, and those untouched by the rashes stampede away. The aching bunch are irresponsibly abandoned and left behind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803624</GUID><Text>Ignore the blisters and continue</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803625</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The most upsetting weeks of their lives ensue from the thoughtless decision. &lt;/b&gt; The constant wailing of the aching bunch wrecks everyone's nerves. Their blisters become as unbearably painful as nauseating to behold — they continue to swell, covering up most of their bodies. It takes days for the throbbing bags of liquid to pop and peel off, leaving the hosts with bright red oozing wounds. Massive scars will forever remind them of their harrowing pain.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803626</GUID><Text>The Dynamite Tree</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803627</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ominous black spikes that covered the tree's trunk were far from the only danger it posed to the crew.&lt;/b&gt; As they were carefully circling around it, a loud bang was heard and a man was sent to the floor with a painful yell. One of the tree's fist-sized wooden fruits had exploded, sending surprisingly sharp splinters into the man's right flank. Moving him could be fatal, but the shade of a tree that drops grenades is not the safest place to perform a surgery.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803628</GUID><Text>Rapidly remove the shards on the spot</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803629</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your doctor's fingers move as a prestidigitator's. &lt;/b&gt;He quickly feels the man's abdomen and locates every shard, pulling them out methodically before stitching the patient up. The crew escape the hazardous tree's vicinity within the space of a few minutes — just in time to elude two new explosions.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803630</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Stress and inexperience slow your doctor down. &lt;/b&gt; With trembling fingers, he slowly pulls a piece of wood out of the man's abdomen — but there are many left to go, and the menacing creaks above his head makes the young doctor shudder even more violently. Before long, another pumpkin-shaped grenade blasts both patient and doctor with wooden shrapnel. The latter manages to shield himself from the brunt of it with his forearms, but the patient is now coughing up blood.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803631</GUID><Text>Finish the surgery</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803632</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Despite his wounds, adrenaline steadies the doctor's hand. &lt;/b&gt; Aided by two members of the crew, he decides to perform a laparotomy and open the patient's abdomen up. It's a gruesome, painful procedure, which curdles the blood of everyone present — but nevertheless, the shards are successfully removed. With the surgery finished, half the crew may be left covered in blood and viscera, but both men can now be safely taken back to the ship for recovery.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803633</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The surgery was doomed to fail. &lt;/b&gt; The doctor attempts to pull out another shard, but his own wounds make him shake uncontrollably, and he punctures a major blood vessel. A nurse tries to stop the haemorrhage, but he is too late: the patient bleeds out by the murderous tree. The crew help the sobbing doctor up, and dolefully walk away from its blood-soaked roots.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803634</GUID><Text>Follow the same military protocol as if you were under grenadiers' fire</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803635</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"I've witnessed more grenade injuries than I'd like to remember; this is no different". &lt;/b&gt; A grizzly sailor comes forward and pushes the injured doctor aside. "We can't repair the damage, but we may be able to contain it long enough to get him to a clinic." He ties a firm knot around the critical areas and tightly braces the wounded man with cloth and bandages to prevent any potential haemorrhages. It is not perfect, and the man's howls clearly state that it is in no way painless, but he survives long enough to be treated at the nearest village.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803636</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;If the crew were truly under enemy fire, they would all perish. &lt;/b&gt; Not one voice is heard above the heated discussion. "Getting away from danger is the priority, just help him up!", "He'll bleed out!", "Just swathe him together and let's get out of here!". Unable to reach an agreement, and with the explosive fruit dangling above their heads, a grizzly sailor decides to take matters into his own hands — quite literally. "Better out than in!", he grunts, as he dips his bare fingers into the man's open wounds and pulls out the gory pieces before the horrified gaze of the doctor. But it's too late to stop him — there's a ripping sound, then a gurgle, and blood starts gushing out the man's mouth. Nothing can be done to stop the bleeding, and the dreadful scene is over within a minute.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803637</GUID><Text>Fashion a stretcher to move him safely</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803638</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An easy feat for your handy crew.&lt;/b&gt; They get to work immediately, and — in the blink of an eye — two long branches, two coats and a symmetrical tangle of knots become a rock-solid stretcher. The wounded man is carefully removed from under the grenade-bearing canopy and carried back to the ship, where the surgeon is able to safely extract every piece of timber shrapnel.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803639</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Stress only serves to highlight your crew's lack of skill.&lt;/b&gt; Eager to get away from the lethal tree's canopy as fast as possible, they hastily tie two branches together and call it a stretcher. The precarious device barely holds the weight of the wounded man, and it collapses almost immediately. The man hits the floor with a thud, and his howl of pain forecast the worst: a fragment has pierced his liver. The man writhes in a feverish agony for days, before drawing his last breath.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803640</GUID><Text>La Manzanilla de la Muerte</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803641</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An officer has taken a bite out of a fragrant, but deadly fruit. &lt;/b&gt; By the time your guide alerts the crew to "stay away from la manzanilla de la muerte", its sweet taste has already been rapidly followed by a peppery tingle, then an excruciating burn. Soon, the officer is frantically gasping for breath, his throat and tongue having tripled in size.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803642</GUID><Text>Puncture an airway</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803643</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew are hypnotised by your doctor's precision.&lt;/b&gt; Without wasting a single second, she lays the officer in the sand, commands two men to pin him down, feels her patient's Adam's apple and makes one steady incision. She then inserts the handle of the scalpel and rotates it to open the new orifice up. The sudden suction sound as air rushes back into the officer's lungs triggers a communal sigh of relief. The whole crew can finally resume breathing.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803644</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew stir before the grisly scene.&lt;/b&gt; The panicked doctor — who's clearly never attempted such a procedure before — stabs the officer in the throat with her knife in an attempt to poke a hole for him to breathe through. Instead, the patient's blood spurts out onto her face. Her piercing shriek makes the whole crew shudder. The man falls to his knees and bleeds to death within seconds.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803645</GUID><Text>Calm the officer and steady his breathing</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803646</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat's voice soothes everyone around him.&lt;/b&gt; He firmly grasps the officer by the shoulders and helps him lie down on his side. He gently instructs the officer to picture a toy horse, rocking softly back and forth with his every breath. Now that the man is not panicking, a small stream of air finds its way through his swollen windpipe — but urgent treatment is required to remove the toxins from his body before it causes more damage.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803647</GUID><Text>Perform a stomach pumping</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803649</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Before receiving the command, your doctor was already preparing to treat the officer. &lt;/b&gt;She had clean warm water, ready to be pumped into — and back out of — her patient's stomach through a rubber tube she'd expertly passed through the tiny gap left in his swollen pharynx. The gastric lavage is successful, and the officer's windpipe slowly clears out. It isn't until he's out of danger that the whole crew realises everyone had been holding their breath.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803650</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Negligent' falls short of describing your doctor.&lt;/b&gt; In an attempt to purge the poisonous fruit from the man's stomach, she pours seawater into the poor officer's mouth. Not only does he howl in pain the second salt touches his inflamed throat, but the seawater makes him heave and choke on his blocked airway. The officer convulses and gurgles for five very long minutes, before he stops twitching altogether.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803651</GUID><Text>Make powdered charcoal to clean the toxins</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803652</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You master crafter conducts every crew member as a perfectly synchronised orchestra.&lt;/b&gt; "Not just any charcoal will do — it needs to burn at a very high temperature, and we don't have much time!" An airtight clay oven is set up and smoking in the blink of an eye. Not an hour has passed before the powdered charred coconut shells are being fed to the agonising officer, cleansing his body of every toxin.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803653</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew's ineptitude proves fatal.&lt;/b&gt; Even though the doctor insists that the charcoal must have been burnt at a very high temperature for it to absorb the poison from the body, all they can think of is setting up a bonfire and charring some driftwood. After making the officer snort the hastily powdered coals, the patient starts bleeding profusely out of his mouth and nose, choking and writhing in agony. There is nothing your crew can do for the man but put him out of the misery they aggravated.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803654</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Every word that blurts out of your first mate's mouth makes the man fret more violently.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew members can but watch, helpless and distraught, as the agonising officer's lips turn purple, then blue, while the first mate continues to screech at him to "just calm down and breathe in". The look of panic in the man's eyes pierces the souls of every man and woman present just before he falls unconscious. Nothing can be done for him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800171</GUID><Text>The Inspector</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800172</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'I do hope you've nothing to hide?'&lt;/b&gt; smirks the Royal Inspector, as his soldiers help him aboard from the row boat. Sailors twitch. Your ship is certain to contravene her majesty's law, since it has encroached into demilitarised waters.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800173</GUID><Text>Quickly forge an official document</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800177</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Very good'&lt;/b&gt;, grimaces the Royal Inspector, scarcely concealing his displeasure at having to let you off the hook. His remonstrations with his soldiers as he wobbles aboard the row boat are a great source of amusement for the crew in days to come.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800174</GUID><Text>Threaten him and his soldiers</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800178</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Inspector's lip wobbles.&lt;/b&gt; 'I beg you,' he says, 'I have a gift, if only you will spare us.' Sure enough, the gift is brought aboard as promised. But it is only once the Inspector and his soldiers are gone, that it feels safe enough to inspect the new acquisition.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800179</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Inspector's face pales&lt;/b&gt; as he eyes the tigerish crew. He bows, and takes a half-step backward - a signal for his soldiers to disembark with him. Once gone, the crew breathe a great sigh of relief, knowing it to have been a close shave.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800180</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'This is far from over!'&lt;/b&gt; the Inspector snarls as he evacuates his men to the row boat. Sure enough, back aboard the royal clipper, he is seen making preparations to attack.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800185</GUID><Text>Set sail and try to outrun them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800187</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Slippery as an eel,&lt;/b&gt; steady navigation keeps your ship on the windward side, just out of the Inspector's clutches. After a tense pursuit he is forced to give up, to the crew's great relief.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800188</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Though the ungainly clipper is outmanoeuvred,&lt;/b&gt; the expedition is now many miles off course, and your ship's exhausted navigators must summon all their remaining stamina to get things back on track.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800189</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's upsetting that the Inspector's clipper&lt;/b&gt; is near out of sight, when a hopeful last shot finds its mark, crashing in the main deck of your ship, and killing a luckless sailor. Despite having escaped, the crew are rattled by such ill luck.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800190</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Complete confusion among the navigators&lt;/b&gt; makes your ship a sitting duck, and the Inspector's clipper gleefully riddles it with cannonfire. Many die or are wounded, and the ship is left in shreds.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800186</GUID><Text>Sink the toad!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800191</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The last they expect is a quick counter.&lt;/b&gt; Surprised and windless, they're an easy mark. Your cannons flog the Inspector's clipper without reply, and before long, it is bubbling to the depths. The relieved crew scout the flotsam for spoils.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800192</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Though the royal clipper has it worse,&lt;/b&gt; it also deals significant damage to your ship in the chaotic exchange. With casualties and repairs on both sides, the ships agree to part, so that they may lick their wounds.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800193</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The speed and power of the royal clipper&lt;/b&gt; is impossible to match despite best efforts. Your ship takes significant damage, and a young sailor is killed by shrapnel. Retreat is the only option. Mercifully the Inspector chooses not to make pursuit.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800194</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The superior clipper chews through your ship&lt;/b&gt; with its dread bank of cannons - the ruthless Inspector intent on bringing traitors to their knees. 'We surrender!' the crew cry, but the plea falls on deaf ears. Once he has shredded the ship to bits, the smug Inspector turns his clipper about, and disappears into the distance.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800181</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There is a commotion&lt;/b&gt; and the Inspector's soldiers are already among the crew. Being exceptionally well-drilled, they quickly force the crew to drop their weapons.

Unless…' he winks grotesquely, '...we can come to some arrangement?'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800198</GUID><Text>Trade with the Inspector (Bribe)</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800200</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Load these crates aboard the clipper!&lt;/b&gt; What are you waiting for?' he huffs to his men.

As the nit-picking Inspector leaves, it is clear an arduous refit is needed before your expedition will be allowed to continue.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800196</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'This is obviously a military vessel,'&lt;/b&gt; the Inspector says, 'in sovereign sea subject to the amnesty.' He toys with the gold button of his greatcoat. 'There will be severe consequences, unless... I hope you don't intend to offer me a bribe?'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800202</GUID><Text>Trade with the Inspector (Bribe)</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800203</GUID><Text>Take consequences</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800205</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'I don't know what you were thinking,&lt;/b&gt; bringing an armed ship into these peaceful waters,' he says, 'but I take great pleasure in imposing upon you. the longest possible route around.' Once the Inspector has gone, the crew look to one another in dismay.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800182</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A disastrous melee ensues,&lt;/b&gt; in which the crew do not acquit themselves well. Some are skewered, the rest disarmed. The Inspector calls three captive sailors forward. 'Hang these men,' he says, and they are promptly strung from a beam until dead. Your ship, he decrees, must leave sovereign waters and take the long way round.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800184</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A disastrous melee ensues,&lt;/b&gt; in which the crew do not acquit themselves well. Some are skewered, the rest disarmed. The Inspector picks out the captive specialist. 'Hang this traitor,' he says, and promptly strings them from a beam until dead.

Surprising even his own soldiers, the Inspector demands a gift be brought over from the clipper to mark the occasion. Of course, when he finally leaves, the crew collapse about in relief.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800207</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Very well,'&lt;/b&gt; says the Inspector, after being given the first mate's 'special tour' of nothing in particular. He silently surveys the vessel for a torturous moment, before declaring 'it all seems above board.' Of course, as soon as he and his soldiers have disembarked, the crew of your ship collapse about in grievous relief.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800208</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Save your breath, windbag,'&lt;/b&gt; says the Inspector, with an air of a man accustomed to weaselling. 'Show me the damn ship, or I shall become vexed!'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800209</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'You've talked yourself into very serious trouble,'&lt;/b&gt; the Inspector sneers, pointing to three unlucky sailors. 'Hang them,' he says, and they are promptly strung from a beam until dead. Your ship, he decrees, must leave sovereign waters and take the long way round.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800210</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'You've talked yourself into very serious trouble,'&lt;/b&gt; the Inspector sneers, and points at your specialist. 'Hang this traitor,' he says, and promptly strings them from a beam until dead. Your ship, he decrees, must leave sovereign waters and take the long way round.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801607</GUID><Text>The Trial</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801609</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew face the bloody customs of foreign lands.&lt;/b&gt; After a night of feasting, the sailors believe that meeting the foreign prince and his sea-travelling court is the highlight of their trip. However, morning comes with news of a sudden death among the court, as your crew find themselves immediately accused of murder. The prince demands a trial by combat, and your men are left with little freedom but the choice of the challenge's nature.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801610</GUID><Text>Send your strongest fighter for a brawl</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801613</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What could a lord do against a sea-forged champion?&lt;/b&gt; The prince's warrior is nothing more than a scarecrow in shiny armor, and your own cotton-clad fighter scoffs at his tacky opponent. The walking wardrobe is tripped, grabbed, and thrown overboard in a single movement. As per foreign laws, your crew receives compensation and their name is cleared.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801614</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No word is brutal enough to describe your opponent.&lt;/b&gt; If his plate armor is scaled to match the man inside, then that man is a giant. The human mountain reaches to grab your fighter and crushes his skull like he would an apple. Word of your crew's feebleness and alleged crimes is sent for all cities to know and spread.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801611</GUID><Text>Send your best shot for a pistol duel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801615</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your gunslinger shoots faster than his own shadow.&lt;/b&gt; His opponent drops to the ground before anyone can see or even understand that a gun has been fired, and only the banging sound and fuming barrel testify to the attack. The prince wonders how lucky your sharpshooter is, then reluctantly graces the crew and presents them with compensation for his offence.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801616</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Speed is not in your gunslinger's vocabulary.&lt;/b&gt; The prince's duelist, displaying the look of men who fill graves but never dig them, is the sharpest shooter your sailors have ever seen. Your best shot is dead before he even touches the handle of his gun. Judging his passing to be too low a price, the prince randomly selects men among your crew and has them hanged for good measure.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801612</GUID><Text>Send your brightest officer for a trial of wits</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801617</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The foreigners are drawn in by your officer's pace.&lt;/b&gt; He inspects the body, noticing knife cuts of varying depths and bleeding. Through methodical questioning, the officer presses the foreigners and reveals the deception: each wound was made by a different hand, the victim was killed by all of them! The prince buys the sailors' silence and they leave wondering what could have motivated the curious murder.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801618</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A mute would have pleaded better.&lt;/b&gt; The officer engages in a battle of arguments with the prince's vizier, and each of his meager claims are met with factual evidence of their contrary. The prince cuts the exchange with exasperation and has the officer taken to be quartered till torn apart as a final judgement for the supposed crime. No scream ever matches the ones heard that day.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802020</GUID><Text>Tavern Troubles</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802021</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;These hoodlums are asking for it.&lt;/b&gt; To each harbour its own ill-famed tavern, and this one is no exception. While your crew enjoys a beer at the counter, the tavern's door slams open, the bartender stiffens and the volume of conversations dwindles: the newcomers are regulars of the bad kind. One of the scruffy men elbows your doctor and gasps as the alcohol splashes on his unkempt clothes. He immediately grabs your sailor by the collar, and demands an apology.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802022</GUID><Text>They want to fight? Let them come!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802025</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew crushes them.&lt;/b&gt; The collar-grabbed doctor slaps away the hand of the hoodlum, seizes his sleeve and pulls him over his shoulder, sending him crashing into a table. With a roar, the other thugs pounce on your sailors, who greet them with jabs to the chin and sternum, downing the attackers with no more than two hits per man - the seconds for the pleasure of good fighting form. The tavern applauds the action, and the bartender offers a round to celebrate a well deserved beating.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802026</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew overestimated themselves.&lt;/b&gt; As he calls for the other sailors to help, the doctor gets his head smashed into the counter. His crewmates scream for revenge, and look like toddlers agitating their little arms to try and hit the big bad guys. The thugs are not in the mood to play along, and one of them stabs a bawling sailor in the liver to make them shut up. They slowly die as the thugs depart, leaving the tavern in a stupor.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802023</GUID><Text>Offer them a drink to ease the tension</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802027</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The language of alcohol is universal.&lt;/b&gt; The thugs take you up on your offer, and eye the sailors' purses as they pass the money around to pay for the beers. As the first round arrives, one of the hoodlums speaks up and announces that they will have a drinking contest with the crew. The idea is one-sided, and weirdly different from their previous aggressive attitude.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802029</GUID><Text>Show them the drinking ability of seafarers</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802031</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They call that cat piss strong?&lt;/b&gt; There's no question regarding who wins the drinking contest: your crew are still standing and enjoying the beers long after the thugs have hit the ground, curled into whatever their stomach rejected. The pungent smell of vomit and cheap ale does not deter the sailors, who casually finish their steins, pay for them, and drag the hoodlums to the closest man of law.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802032</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What kind of liquid fire do they make this with?&lt;/b&gt; The crew are used to strong drinks and exotic ales, but the tavern's special mixture of bourbon, sugar and Ricard is way past what they can handle. The thugs are accustomed to this local horror and barely wobble, while your sailors pass out one after the other. When they wake up, obviously, their purses are missing.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802030</GUID><Text>Drug their drinks to avoid the confrontation</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802033</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;War anaesthetics are remarkably useful against small-time thugs.&lt;/b&gt; After a few rounds spent boasting their virile resistance to any kind of liquor, the crew notice the drop in attention of their opponents, and their doctor seizes the opportunity, lacing the incoming mugs with just the right dosage of chloroform. The snoring hoodlums are delivered to the local authorities, who enjoy the unexpected present.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802034</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The dosage doesn't put the thugs to sleep: it kills them.&lt;/b&gt; The doctor sidles among the thugs, lacing their drinks and snickering in expectation. Soon the effects appear: the gang shows drowsiness, then nausea, before losing control of their movements and tumbling against the counter, their faces taking on a waxy yellow color. The crew can do nothing as the hoodlums break into seizures and foam at the mouth. They win the drinking contest by default, as murderers of their opponents.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802028</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Bribing them with alcohol doesn't seem to work.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew invites the men to sit and share a beer, on them, to try and bring the tension down. The thug doesn't let go of the doctor, and points at the aligned liquors behind the bartender. A glass of all of these, he says, and a bottle of your best whatever. That's way more than they can drink - and way more than your sailors can afford.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802035</GUID><Text>If it's a fight they want, they'll get one</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802036</GUID><Text>Pay up</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802037</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew are humiliated.&lt;/b&gt; They empty their purses trying to pay for the excessive demands of the thugs. Ale. Stew. Liquors. Meats. When sunrise pushes the hoodlums to leave the tavern, the sailors are stuck with cooking, dishwashing and dust-wiping until the bartender considers their debt paid.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802024</GUID><Text>This is a waste of time - simply apologise</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802038</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors apologise through gritted teeth.&lt;/b&gt; Pleased by their groveling, the thugs don't pester them anymore, yet the heavy stares of the other clients push your crew to leave the tavern. Next time, they'll show them. Next time.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802987</GUID><Text>Snow Globe</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803026</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Sails frozen, food rotten, and a ship on the brink of breaking.&lt;/b&gt; It's a blizzard! All notion of time and direction has long been lost: a never-ending tempest of snow surrounds the ship, blurring the limits between night and day, or sky and sea. Stalactites have imprisoned your sails, binding them to the masts and making them creak under the unexpected weight. Your crew fear they might break, but should anyone venture outside while violent winds whip the upper deck?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802991</GUID><Text>Climb the mast and detach the frozen sails</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802993</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ship can safely withstand the blizzard.&lt;/b&gt; Several sailors of impressive build climb your masts to unhook and detach the heavy sails, and despite the slippery wood and tightly frozen ropes, they manage to free the masts of the dangerous weight. The barren poles stand tall against the receding storm. Morning light soon pierces the clouds - a good omen to salute your crew's efforts, and accompany their celebration.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802994</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The task is far from easy.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors have good strength, and are used to climbing the masts, but they lack either luck or skill when it comes to speed. Before they can reach the foremast, the foresail breaks out of its bounds and flaps wildly against the weakened mast, while the other sails continue to foster stalactites of increasing length and weight. The foremast emits a shrilling sound of protest.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802996</GUID><Text>Aim at the ties holding the rogue sail</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803011</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The rogue sail is taken down!&lt;/b&gt; Precise shots take out its ties without so much as scratching the foremast, and the sail is sent to disappear into the storm. The lack of the sail's furious whipping seems to be enough for the mast to hold its ground. When the blizzard recedes, your ship is lacking a sail, but nothing more.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803013</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Alas, your mast is not spared.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors shoot at the ties of the foresail, but the task is too meticulous for them: they shoot at the ropes, the poles, and the mast itself. The raging sail is swallowed by the storm, while the foremast collapses and crushes the starboard. In a final irony, the storm soon calms down, letting your crew see how a lack of meddling would have caused less damage.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802997</GUID><Text>Fire all guns and shake off the ice</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803014</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The stalactites are dealt with.&lt;/b&gt; In a bold act of defiance towards logic and prudence, your artillery men fire their cannons to send precisely gauged vibrations throughout your ship. The foremast protests but resists, while the pikes of ice parasitising its sails break and rain on the deck in a cacophony of tingling sounds. Your maimed ship has but to wait for the blizzard to run out of breath now.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803015</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Reckless, and proportionately paid.&lt;/b&gt; Gauging the difference between power which might break the stalactites only, and power which might also break the mast is beyond the understanding of most humans, your artillery men included. The tremor of the cannons shakes the whole ship, provoking the crashing fall of the foremast. Ironically, the blizzard reacts by calming down, leaving the sailors to their broken ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802995</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A resounding failure.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors clearly don't have the ability to climb the masts, whether in this storm or in clear weather - how could they even be allowed on a ship? As they bicker over their deficiency, the main mast beckons their attention: its base is entirely frozen, and the wood screams against the invading cold.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803016</GUID><Text>Strengthen the mast with chains and planks</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803020</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A straightforward, if rough solution.&lt;/b&gt; Planks and poles are erected around the masts, and bound by ropes and chains in the hope that the swaying barricade will prevent the masts from breaking. Despite its movement, the construction is sturdy, and actually accompanies the masts as they move in the wind, giving them a welcome support. When the blizzard leaves, your ship is plucked naked, but its masts still stand.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803021</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The trigger of catastrophy.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors tie planks and poles around the masts, pulling chains around them as tightly as they can, oblivious to the carpentry laws that apply to the movement of towering objects. The masts try to break free of their man-made prisons, and soon do, crashing onto the deck one after the other. As if chased by the hysteria below, the blizzard flees, lettings its sunrays fall on the barren carcass of your ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803019</GUID><Text>Boil seawater to gather ice-melting salt</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803022</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Somehow, it works.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors take the time to slowly distil seawater in order to avoid improper condensation. The salt is acquired faster than anticipated, and spread over the base of the main mast, forcing the ice back to its liquid form. The blizzard keeps filling the sails until it runs out of breath and recedes, but the furious weather was enough to greatly maim the ship. There will be extensive repairs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803023</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There was no chance of success.&lt;/b&gt; To gather salt, your sailors keep away from the wind and bury below the deck to light a fire under a pot of seawater. Their condenser is poorly handled, and causes the water to fall back into the pot, leaving the crew to believe the fire isn't burning hard enough. They fan the flames. Hell rises. The blizzard is fed gusts of murky smoke, and spits it back out before receding, revealing the half-burnt carcass of your ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802992</GUID><Text>Stay inside and hope the supplies last</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803024</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Prudence and faith pay off.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors huddle together in the lower deck, resisting the temptation to go check the masts and their frozen sails. Time trickles away as the storm recedes, and when the blizzard is no more than a light drizzle, the sun emerges to illuminate your ship. It's perfectly unscathed, and slowly drifts towards the coast, where a harbour is already in sight.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803025</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors' feeble trust is not enough to fuel their patience.&lt;/b&gt; The storm lingers, and with each new gust of raging wind the main mast complains and moans, until the distinct sounds of breaking wood resonate through the ship. That's enough waiting! Several sailors rush to the upper deck in the hope of either strengthening or defrosting the mast.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803920</GUID><Text>Protect the steamship in any way you can</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803921</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You have a hardy legion indeed.&lt;/b&gt; They rush to the tarpaulins, and with commendable teamwork and physical strength in the challenging conditions, are able to pull them over the ship's most sensitive instruments and machinery. Heading below deck to relax, &lt;b&gt;the heroes wait out the storm in luxury&lt;/b&gt; with buttered currant buns and hot tea.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803922</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Their defence of the steamship is a little half-hearted.&lt;/b&gt; Initially the men show willing, but the blizzard quickly wears them down, and they retreat inside claiming that their work is done. After the worst of it has passed, the officers survey the ship. Beneath a poorly affixed and feeble tarpaulin, the engine is found to have suffered damage, albeit fixable. &lt;b&gt;One has to wonder if they are cut out for these kinds of challenges.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803923</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Tragic youthful over-exuberance.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors drain a bottle of strong rum before going back out, perhaps believing machismo will keep them warm. They batten the hatches in the white flurry, stumbling, belching and laughing. The hilarity continues when one of the lads slips and loses his footing — that is, until the steel rim of the funnel meets his head with a clomp. &lt;b&gt;He dies instantly.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804144</GUID><Text>Send an expert diver to unclog the propellers of ice</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804143</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The thrill-seeking diver relishes the task.&lt;/b&gt; Covering themselves in bear fat and brandishing a sharp pick, they enter the water without a splash, resurfacing no more than five minutes later to the embrace of a pre-warmed towel. "All clear!" your diver says. &lt;b&gt;Cheers go up below at the sound of the engines at full power once more.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803609</GUID><Text>At The End Of A Rope</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803600</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A perilous plunge!&lt;/b&gt; Your expedition is walking along a narrow ridge in the rainforest interior, when they become entranced by the scintillating blue of 'Le Cotinga des Mezoas'. Perhaps it is the distraction of looking up at the extraordinary bird that causes someone to misstep. They fall suddenly through the floor, and tumble into fresh air, &lt;b&gt;only an elastic tangle of vines sparing them the drop. The problem now is that they're suspended above a ravine,&lt;/b&gt; and it's a long way down...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803601</GUID><Text>Shout down, "Slash with your sabre!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803602</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's a sword-swishing masterclass!&lt;/b&gt; Your champion contorts to cut the liana above their right arm, and once free, cuts one daringly close to their neck, so that with a trapeze-like ripple they may dismount to the floor of the ravine. "Simple!" they declaim, straightening up, "Follow me if you dare!" There are hoots and cheers from the gallery above as the rest swing down on lianas, like an army of spider monkeys.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803603</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A very lucky escape.&lt;/b&gt; Trying to be cautious, your soldier makes a cut in one of the vines. The harness suddenly lurches down a further ten feet. Still, it seems a long way down. Another cut, and they are in freefall towards the bottom of the gully. Though cushioned somewhat &lt;b&gt;the impact causes a nasty ankle injury.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803604</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You have lost one of your bravest.&lt;/b&gt;The first cut is wild, and sends them into a second tumble: there are gasps from above as your soldier clutches desperately at the foliage, but try as they might, they are unable to find anything to grip. The poor soldier pinwheels to the very bottom of the ravine.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803605</GUID><Text>Call down, "Unpick the knot!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803606</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It turns out to be an enjoyable puzzle.&lt;/b&gt; The knot is examined in tense silence, until the light of revelation falls across their face. A tug here, a loosening there, and then voila! A slipknot forms that allows a breezy absail to the foot of the gorge. Your escapalogist bows to the exultant gallery.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803607</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An infuriating tangle&lt;/b&gt; — by the expression of your trapped expeditioner at least. Every tug seems to tighten the gordian knot further. "Just cut it at the root!" they shout up. "Are you sure?" "Absolutely." When the lianas are cut, there are mere seconds of freefall before the impact. Though slightly cushioned — like a fork wrapped in spaghetti verdi — &lt;b&gt;the drop results in a nasty back injury.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803608</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A deadly conundrum.&lt;/b&gt; The unfortunate victim tries pulling at different strands until one has an effect. The tangle of vegetation falls away but for a loop around the neck, which closes after only a few seconds of freefall, &lt;b&gt;resulting in instant death.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803727</GUID><Text>For Whom The Bell Atolls</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803728</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your ship is pinned on the razor-sharp coral&lt;/b&gt; that fringes an underwater volcano. Since she has rolled onto her side, freeing your ship will require surgical precision if you're to prevent gallons of water from flooding in. If you do not wish to &lt;b&gt;send a team of divers to cut the ship free,&lt;/b&gt; you may instead be able to &lt;b&gt;make or use something clever&lt;/b&gt; to break free.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803729</GUID><Text>Use your diving bell</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803730</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The bell rings true.&lt;/b&gt; Despite plonking into the water at an angle to which it is unaccustomed — the ship being at such a slant — the diving bell descends easily to the scene of your troubles. Through the little glass window, a forest of living pastel appears, of which some of the more beautiful examples are embedded in the hull. Once your divers have detached the lifelinks constraining your vessel, your crew are free to resume what is becoming a fascinating journey.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803731</GUID><Text>Send free divers down to remove the coral</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803732</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your divers take to the sea like fish to water,&lt;/b&gt; having had some dive training with the navy.

Soon after, your heroes emerge from the water giddy and glistening, brandishing the magnificent coral in their hands.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803733</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They can barely hold their breath for long enough&lt;/b&gt; to reach the coral floor, and as such, they're forced to cut the ship free in relays. Error creeps in to their work along with feelings of lightheadedness, and &lt;b&gt;one of the divers slices his foot open on a shank of coral.&lt;/b&gt; Everyone is too absorbed in their task to notice, but once the ship is free and back at sea, the pustulent swelling of the man's foot becomes increasingly difficult to ignore...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803734</GUID><Text>Tend to the diver's foot</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803735</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Although your medic does take immediate action,&lt;/b&gt; vigorously scrubbing the wound and flushing with fresh water and vinegar, the coral cut takes a surprisingly long time to properly heal. "Will I die? Is this the end?" the injured officer complains, as if an invalid to be waited on hand and foot. Thankfully, eventually the swelling reduces, and everyone can get on with their lives.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803736</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Someone puts bandages around the wounds in a haphazard fashion,&lt;/b&gt; as if they were mere scratches. "Change the bandages every few days" is the advice, but the abscess that has formed beneath soon bursts, and the vile infection spreads. &lt;b&gt;The man dies in his sleep.&lt;/b&gt; For the others, their negligence will forever remain a source of great shame — for no man is an island, and the death of one man diminishes the whole.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803737</GUID><Text>Tell him to grin and bear it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803738</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The diver develops a fever.&lt;/b&gt; The abscess does not disappear, and a nasty infection spreads up the arm causing it to become swollen. He will be of no use on the ship for the remainder of the expedition, instead serving only as an unpleasant reminder of the officers' inhuman disregard for the welfare of their crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804080</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is clumsy.&lt;/b&gt; Out of breath and struggling weakly against a strong current, your divers bludgeon blindly at the coral, sending clouds of particles up through the water. Little do they realise how fragile the hull has become. With one misplaced blow, it implodes, and the water comes gushing in. The crew must count themselves lucky that the tide proceeds to sweep the unhappy vessel to the shore. &lt;b&gt;It seems you have shipwrecked on a coral atoll.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803739</GUID><Text>Find a cunning way to free the ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803740</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your ship looks a sensation now she has coral poking from her keel.&lt;/b&gt; Like doctors treating a foreign object, your fine craftsmen utilise a panoply of tools to reach under the hull and fragment the coral. They are then nimbly able to dress the wound in the hull before very much water gets in. The few naughty pieces of coral that remain wedged in the keel look rather fetching!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803741</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They use a lot of spare materials, but it works.&lt;/b&gt; Fighting against the slant of the ship, they are able to fragment the coral with a long pole they have constructed out of wood and rope. It is extremely heavy, however, and as the ship judders free, your men cannot stop it from sliding into the sea. It feels like a waste, and there's only just enough wood left to repair the breach in the hull.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803742</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There is a lot of head-scratching below deck,&lt;/b&gt; as your confused carpenters try to fight the flood. They have neither the tools nor creativity to do much more than smash the coral that has ripped through the ship. When the vessel judders free, it has almost no buoyancy, and the crew count themselves lucky when the lumbering ship is swept ashore on the tide. &lt;b&gt;It seems you have shipwrecked on a coral atoll.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804081</GUID><Text>Send in your specialist diver</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804082</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diver takes to the sea like a fish to water,&lt;/b&gt; having ample experience. Still, the others worry when after five or six minutes, he still has yet to surface. Suddenly, the boat begins to wobble — it has been cut free! Soon after, your hero emerges from the water giddy and glistening — and brandishing some magnificent coral in their hands.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804083</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The accident with the coral reef as left the expedition shipwrecked on an atoll.&lt;/b&gt; For a time your crew feel like children again — dancing along the sand and bathing in the sun, as they await a verdict on the damaged hull. When it comes, the news is not good: an extensive repair is needed, and with supplies so short, there is considerable disagreement. Why &lt;b&gt;concentrate on repairs&lt;/b&gt;, given how long that may take, when &lt;b&gt;you could scout for food and water.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804084</GUID><Text>The Coral Island</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800336</GUID><Text>The Minefield</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800337</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;At the cry of 'mines!', all rush to the prow.&lt;/b&gt; Sure enough, several of the conical terrors bob seductively below. 'Who knows how many of these infernal machines have passed us by, or yet await us. A false move, and this sea shall be a lake of fire! What the devil do we do?'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800338</GUID><Text>Use dynamite to start a chain reaction</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800339</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'The way ahead is clear as the eye can see!'&lt;/b&gt; says the delighted officer, folding up his telescope. As the last motes of fire trail down into the waves and fizzle, the crew can but admire such brave use of dynamite. 'Better than fireworks!' says another, 'The men have never been so entertained!'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800340</GUID><Text>Try to navigate the minefield</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800341</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'We are masters of the sea!'&lt;/b&gt; sing the triumphant crew, as the ship weaves easily beyond the last line of mines. 'Even Odysseus, when faced with Scylla and Charybdis, lost men. We have lost none of our company, and our bonds only strengthen!' Soon, a special bottle is being uncorked, and toasts raised to the continued success of the expedition!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800342</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'What was that noise?' gulps the helmsman,&lt;/b&gt; but fortunately a metallic scraping is not the prelude to a mighty boom. As the ship is fitfully steered betwixt the mines, hearts palpitate, and sailors wring sweat from their jerseys. When the all clear is finally given, there is not a sailor who fails to offer up a prayer to their goddess.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800343</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;While at first plain sailing, the minefield is now gooey with danger.&lt;/b&gt; A line of densely-packed mines stand between the ship and freedom. "With a makeshift device, we might be able to clear the path ahead," explains the officer, "either that, or we just try our best to weave through it."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800348</GUID><Text>Build a device</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800349</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'She survived! It worked!' calls the lookout,&lt;/b&gt; as makeshift grapples trailing behind the little dinghy are able to hook the mines aside. Relief only comes, of course, once the expedition ship is clear of this last line of mines. 'How did we get in such a pickle?' says one. 'At least we're out of it,' says another.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800350</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A nervous sailor rows towards the line of mines.&lt;/b&gt; The makeshift grappling hooks trailing behind his dinghy are intended to drag mines out of the path of the expedition ship. Unfortunately the sailor is a sacrificial goat. A grapple shatters the horns of a nearby mine, and the boat and its sailor explode in plume. Safe passage means nothing to those from whom a good friend was taken.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800351</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The idea is a terrible one from the start.&lt;/b&gt; The lengthy poles, comprised of other poles, are unwieldy and inaccurate, even in the hands of a several strong men. The crew's attempt to poke mines away when they draw near is suicide. Two booms come in succession, and a few feeble cheers at escape are drowned by the deafening wails. Few are left to bail water, when so many lie dead or injured.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802896</GUID><Text>Try to weave through the minefield</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802897</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"What was that noise?" gulps the helmsman,&lt;/b&gt; but fortunately a metallic scraping is not the prelude to a mighty boom.

"Brace!" comes a scream from port-side, just prior to a shower of men and timber being propelled violently upward. That no further detonations follow is of little relief to a crew who've lost a good many sailors, and sustained such significant damage to their ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800344</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The awfulness has barely begun.&lt;/b&gt; Restless waves conceal a thickening of the mines, and the ship's haphazard path makes impact inevitable. 'Brace!' scream port-side, just prior to a portion of men and timber being propelled violently upward. That no further detonations follow is of little relief to a crew who have lost many good sailors, and sustained such significant damage to their ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800352</GUID><Text>Go through diplomatic papers in search of any clues</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800353</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The search is a fruitful one.&lt;/b&gt; The well-organised diplomatic library includes a comprehensive folio of papers on nearby mine positions. This enables the navigators to chart a safe course through the waters. The very same paper remarks that the mines were moored during the war, in order to protect a now-disused outpost. You stop by the outpost and pick up anything that looks useful.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800354</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The search is worthwhile.&lt;/b&gt; After a few hours scouring the diplomatic archives, a paper on nearby mine positions is found. This gives the navigators the difficult task of charting a safe course through the waters. No-one is quite sure if the information given is up-to-the-minute, but when the last line of mines is cleared, all are suitably relieved.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800355</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The documents in the ship archives at first seem exact.&lt;/b&gt; A map is discovered showing the mine positions. It is only once a course has been plotted, and your ship is sailing at speed on its supposedly safe track, that a magnificent bang has the whole crew scrambling. The speed seemed to soften the mine's devastation, but there is still a nasty hole in the hull. A second glance at the map shows it is rather out-of-date. The reckless blunder has cost no lives, but the significant task of repair greatly wearies the crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800356</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Optimism makes way for abject terror,&lt;/b&gt; as the map of mines that is found and used for navigation turns out to be completely false. Terrible detonations devastate the ship's timbers, and countless lives are lost. 'Misinformation is worse than no information,' an officer laments, as his tears bleed the ink of the erroneous chart, which as it happens, refers to a different stretch of water.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800357</GUID><Text>Turn around and try to escape</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800358</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A few saintly volunteers approach,&lt;/b&gt; offering to scout back the way you came and ease your escape. Asked if they aren't afraid of the cone-shaped mines, they reply 'The lord will see us through.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800359</GUID><Text>Allow them to go ahead</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800361</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The volunteers exude calm,&lt;/b&gt; as their lone dinghy traces a path much akin to that which got you into this mess. Although their silent vigil transports you to safety, all agree they should never have ended up in a minefield in the first place.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800362</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;While the path the volunteers cut is a true one,&lt;/b&gt; it does not account for the difference in size between the two ships. It only takes a narrow graze to explode one of the mines, and though no lives are lost, the damage to your ship is significant. The crew are dismayed by the situation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800363</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;For the godless dinghy, doom seems inevitable&lt;/b&gt; the moment it drops and a man slops overboard. This inauspicious beginning foreshadows the disaster to follow. Prayers unheard, steering in the rough current proves impossible. The little boat is last seen careening towards the sinister cones it sought to avoid. 'The terrible loss of life shall remain with me all my days,' says a devastated officer.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800364</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is horrifying that most significant members of the crew&lt;/b&gt; are aboard this fragile dinghy. Of course one would not wish a mine to explode any loyal man, but when it bellows up below a collection of your finest, death stings all the more. The crew are understandably devastated at the destruction they have witnessed first-hand. Life feels as if it may never be the same again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800360</GUID><Text>Tell them to stay on the ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800365</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your faith goes untried&lt;/b&gt; in the nervous silence, as the ship escapes the mine trap the same way it entered. All agree they should never have ended up in a minefield in the first place.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800366</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your faith does not go untried.&lt;/b&gt; The sinister cones have moved about over time, and no matter how truly the ship follows its original course, it is inevitable a mine will burst into the hull. Luckily when the blast comes, no man dies. Still, the burdensome schedule of repair disheartens the crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800367</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;None of it is of any use.&lt;/b&gt; Your godforsaken crew do not realise how the sinister cones move about over time. No matter how true the course, more than one mine shakes the ship's belly as it limps clear. Many lives are lost, and the damage to the ship is severe.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800575</GUID><Text>Lost in the Desert</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800576</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The map of these endless dunes is a swindle.&lt;/b&gt; The first officer turns to berate the guide from whom they were purchased, but the fellow is already gone, as if the sands had swallowed him up. A solitary well offers a slight dribble of consolation, but your men must otherwise come to terms with being rather lost.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800577</GUID><Text>Use a reflective object to signal help</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800581</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A local rider comes to the rescue.&lt;/b&gt; He saunters over on his camel, and explains the well is part of a lost city, accessible over a small rise. The crew are enchanted by the grand quarry, swept over by the sands of time, observations of which shall no doubt bring them fame on their return. After proof of their remarkable discovery has been gathered, the rider is only too glad to lead the elated crew back to more familiar dunes.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800578</GUID><Text>Navigate by the stars</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800582</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Clear desert nights are perfect for astronomers.&lt;/b&gt; Beneath a black cloak lucid with the constellations, your expert navigators school the remainder in mankind's relation to the heavenly bodies. It is a moment of realisation for many. Enlightened, the crew return to the ship filled with the wonder of the desert and their place in the universe.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800583</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Something of a path appears&lt;/b&gt;, though as much by luck as star-gazing. A little way along it, a silhouette crenellates the night - an imposing fortress. Too tired for trouble, you wonder if it is worth knocking at the grand door.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800586</GUID><Text>Ask at the fort for help</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800588</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The occupant Sultan welcomes you in.&lt;/b&gt; He introduces himself in his own tongue, and is impressed by your interpreters. "You are far from what you seek. Stay, replenish for the journey ahead." Thus the crew enjoy the Sultan's hospitality while they can, for it will ease the last stretch of their journey.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800589</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You lack the means to communicate.&lt;/b&gt; Believing you to be an invasion force, the paranoid Sultan orders hot oil be poured from the ramparts. There is no escaping for one, eaten alive by the molten cascade. Resuming your desert path is the only option. The journey is a wearying lament for a fallen friend, meandering slowly back to civilisation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800587</GUID><Text>Ignore the fort and continue along the path</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800590</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is a long and draining journey.&lt;/b&gt; Finally the crew limp exhausted into a settlement, from where it will no doubt be possible to procure the appropriate charts. Most would be happy never to see those grumpy old camels ever again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800584</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The "stars are fickle", say your officers by way of excuse.&lt;/b&gt; After travelling for a while, the familiar shape of the well appears in the darkness. Your men have been walking in a circle.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800585</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The stars utterly perplex your party.&lt;/b&gt; With romantic notions dashed, the crew look around for some landmark, but instead find a featureless wasteland. They are desperately lost. Water, food and hope are in increasingly short supply. But even in a desert, there must be a way...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800591</GUID><Text>Follow the local wildlife</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800594</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Desperate thanks are due to a dung beetle.&lt;/b&gt; As it scuttles along, those less capable in coleopterology cast doubt on the value of pursuing it. There is a minor scuffle in the sand before at last the bloody-nosed experts are listened to. The jolly beetle leads to owl dung, and owls in turn to farmland. Thus the embittered and exhausted crew are saved from desiccation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800595</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A wild goose chase to desolation.&lt;/b&gt; Though the ostrich your crew have found cannot fly, it lollops along at surprisingly high speed. They try in vain to follow, but the sun is twice its usual size, and the bird is gone. Hot sand melts soles, and feet begin to swell. The water is out. Those that make it must have some evolutionary adaptation, because for most the desert is to be their graveyard.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800592</GUID><Text>Divine for Water</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800596</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your reprobates have no knowledge of desert mysteries.&lt;/b&gt; The divining rod has wasted enough of your time, and your caravan is nearly through the water.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800597</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A pretty price for divine mercy.&lt;/b&gt; The Y-shaped stick leads all on a meandering path. One insists on stopping to dig, and is left behind. It is a wasted, and fatal effort. After two days of hardship, the rest stumble over a crest to discover the wide blue sea, their mocking ship upon it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800593</GUID><Text>Move bravely on</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800598</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sun is unspeakably hot.&lt;/b&gt; As the bedraggled lumber back to civilisation, there are wiltings among them. It is too much for the others to turn their heads. Bodies slumping to ash and dust, lost to the waves of a powder sea.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800579</GUID><Text>Wait for a sign of the true path</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800599</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Star of wonder, star of light!&lt;/b&gt; Your wise magi are stirred by an unusually bright celestial body, that is surely a sign! It foretells a spiritual pilgrimage through the desert leading to a Garden of Eden. A grove of flowing streams, orange and incense, where like-minded devotees congregate. Your crew feel blessed, and the expedition can resume with new-found devotion.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800600</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Are the gods testing you?&lt;/b&gt; You wait and wait but there is not yet a sign.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800601</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The omen is a ravaging howl.&lt;/b&gt; "Water in the desert?! it's coming from everywhere!" Already up to their necks in strong current, the weak swimmers flounder like ants in a bathtub. Those that do not drown must wait until morning to look upon the aftermath. "A flood from heaven, to punish the wicked," say the survivors, as they trudge back to civilisation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800580</GUID><Text>Walk stubbornly in one direction</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800602</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You are extremely lucky to survive.&lt;/b&gt; The crew whinge and whine the whole way about scattergun strategy. After a day without shade, a fight even breaks out. But sticking to the fixed heading eventually leads, not before time, back to some kind of reality.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800603</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your expedition boils.&lt;/b&gt; Further and further it goes, into the desert's incandescent interior. Each soul more and more convinced that redemption is over the next dune. But it is not. Three days later, the party might have felt relief at the sight of a caravan, but instead end up wishing they had died with their comrades.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801642</GUID><Text>Scylla and Charybdis</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801643</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew attempts the crossing of a vicious strait.&lt;/b&gt; Like Odysseus along the coasts of Sicily, they see a subsidiary current running counter to the main flow, its strength so wild it brings fish with deformed eyes and luminescent bellies to the surface. What creatures are not swallowed by this whirlpool end up impaled on the shore's nasty teeth.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801646</GUID><Text>Avoid the whirlpool and maneuver to dodge the shore</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801648</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Odysseus didn't have the ability of your navigators.&lt;/b&gt; Through a series of tight maneuvers and expert understanding of the furious currents, they drive the ship between the whirlpool and the shore, using the provided momentum to dash ahead. The moment is as brief as it is intense, and the crew rejoice, laughing like children under the cold droplets of crashing waves.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801649</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The maneuver is even more complicated than expected.&lt;/b&gt; The ship is driven alongside the whirlpool and flirts with the shore, the racket of the water covering the orders shouted by officers. The current speeds up, inexorably pulling the ship towards the reef.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801651</GUID><Text>Spin the ship to take the damage on its flank</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801653</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A frontal crash is avoided, but it is a crash nonetheless.&lt;/b&gt; The whole ship protests against the unnatural movement, its rudder straining against the current and its hull complaining loudly against the maneuver until the impact silences it. The repairs are much lighter than they could have been.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801654</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your navigators cannot control the wild ship.&lt;/b&gt; The maneuver sends it spinning and it plunges into the reef prow first. If it weren't for the metal cast protecting the vessel, the crew would have been crushed as well. The repairs, which take place both in the swirling waters and on the knife-like rocks, are excruciating.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801652</GUID><Text>Bombard the shore in an attempt to slow the ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801655</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Power faces power in a risky but successful attempt.&lt;/b&gt; All cannons are fired in the shore's direction, in a surprisingly efficient effort to slow the ship down. The ship lands on the devastated coast and the hull is barely grated by the remains of the broken stone spears.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801656</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What did they expect, attacking nature itself?&lt;/b&gt; The massive teeth of stone barely tremble under the cannon's fire, and the recoil is a futile strength against the voracious current. The rock jaw catches the ship and grinds the upper deck, sending several sailors to be served as the strait's daily food.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801650</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Fear clouds the navigators' readings.&lt;/b&gt; Unable to choose between several possible courses which could all end in disaster, they opt for a stunned silence and let the crew maneuver on their own. The ship crashes on the shore in an explosion of metal and wood which sends a dozen men overboard and straight into the rock fangs of the coast. It is more a wreck than a ship which escapes the deadly strait.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801647</GUID><Text>Avoid the shore and hope the whirlpool won't suck the ship in</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801657</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors' fright gives them wings.&lt;/b&gt; The crew reacts to each order with unparalleled speed, too occupied to plead the heavens to think of discussing the risky manoeuvres that are asked of them. When at last the whirlpool is passed, their belief that the Almighty might have his eyes on this ship is stronger than ever.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801658</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There are only so many disasters faith can prevent.&lt;/b&gt; When they understand that the whirlpool is a monster none should face, the sailors fall to their knees to pray and beg, abandoning what meaningless impact they could have had on the ship's trajectory. Like Circe prophesied to Odysseus, the currents attack the ship, the men, and a hero.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802115</GUID><Text>The Volcano</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802116</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Tremors, ash rain, and an oddly bright night: it's an eruption!&lt;/b&gt; The island was too lush and bountiful to be harmless. The lava responsible for the fertile ground creeps from the mouth of the waking volcano, and towards the jungle where a party of your men had erected camp for the night.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802117</GUID><Text>Go back to the ship despite the darkness.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802119</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ship is quickly found.&lt;/b&gt; The burning lights of the volcano illuminate the jungle, and a handful of seasoned explorers lead the rest of the sailors back to the ship, zigzagging between shadows and fleeing animals. The vessel departs as the island is engulfed by flames, a vision as terrible as it is magnificent.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802120</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors are swallowed by the jungle's maze.&lt;/b&gt; Dense trees, moving shadows, screeching animals and the crew itself, whose silhouettes are deformed by the scorching heat - too many visions allow panic to spread among the men, who cannot recognise the path, and never make it back to the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802118</GUID><Text>Find shelter against the incoming lava</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802121</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Shelter!&lt;/b&gt; The crew finds a decrepit stone chapel, the remains of a colonialist power, and deems it better refuge than their cloth-made tents. An officer estimates that the lava will be on them soon: there's no choice but to spend the night here.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802125</GUID><Text>Pray for the chapel to hold</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802127</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The chapel miraculously stands its ground.&lt;/b&gt; Lava rolls against its walls and forks around the white stone, melting its paint and parching its plaster. Nestled on the only facade left untouched by the flow, the chapel's wooden door seems like the most fragile object the sailors have ever seen. When day comes, they are safe and elated, and all kiss the blessed door before leaving.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802128</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Their faith is nothing but hypocrisy in need.&lt;/b&gt; The crew remembers old prayers from their worshipping days, but the years have eroded both their memory and their beliefs. They can only watch as the lava packs against the chapel's stained glass and breaks through. The spray of molten stone and broken glass scars all of them but kills none: a bite to remind them of their lack of dedication.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802126</GUID><Text>Dig trenches in the holy ground</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802129</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The trenches are dug with military efficiency.&lt;/b&gt; Despite the darkness and the imminent danger, the sailors manage to dig deep trenches in no time, and the pits redirect the lava as it flows down the hill. The sailors bunker down in the chapel as the lava runs around the outside, illuminating the stained glass, leaving them to rejoice in the warm comfort of their shelter.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802130</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Too much pressure and too little grit.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors can dig little more than scattered and knee-deep pits, which have a negligible impact on the lava's course. As the crew scurries inside the chapel, so to does the lava, its smoke burning throats and forever robbing the men of their voices.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802122</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew are lost and perplexed.&lt;/b&gt; Even your most committed explorers cannot wrap their heads around the complexity of the jungle, which changes with every newly burnt tree. It seems that every path might end in lava-devoured dead ends.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802131</GUID><Text>Follow a random animal and trust its instincts</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802133</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The animals run to the beach, and your crew follows.&lt;/b&gt; Tracking down the herd of shrill, squealing, screeching critters could be done with eyes closed, and the sailors are led to the shore where they had beached. The ship departs in a hurry, leaving the animals to die in the ruthless volcano fire.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802134</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your hunters find no pattern in the animals' frenzy.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors run in a display of panic and poor judgment, mimicking the animals' desperate behavior. The crew still on the ship can only watch in horror as the island's greatest predator burns all its prey, be they beast or human.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802132</GUID><Text>Pick a random path and trust your instincts</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802135</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Fear is the most reliable instinct.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors scamper through the jungle, chasing after their lava-lit shadows. They stumble upon the beach by pure miracle, and hop on the ship with molten tongues on their heels. The ship departs with a slightly charred hull, but a safe crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802136</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Fear is a treacherous adviser.&lt;/b&gt; Seeing that the only unburnt path is up, the sailors climb the jungle's trees in an attempt to escape the lava flow. Ground, then bark, then branches, then humans: everything burns. In the distance, the ship's remaining crew stay transfixed as they witness the volcano island devouring itself.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802138</GUID><Text>Selfless Deeds</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802139</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"They steal your children?"&lt;/b&gt; The air hangs heavy around the sailors as their question withers in the hut. Their hosts consider the explorers, half-hopeful, half-guilty from the certitude that non-paying jobs are not the ones your crew enjoys. One child has to be offered with each new moon, an elder explains as she gestures towards the nearby river, or else bandits raid the surrounding settlements. Tomorrow, the bandits' steamboat will come to claim this village's due.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802140</GUID><Text>Board the bandits' steamer with your gunboat</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802144</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your assault is swift, and without a single casualty.&lt;/b&gt; The kidnappers offer no resistance, as their carcass of a craft faces your own fresh-from-the-factory gunboat. They reluctantly lead you to their hideout - a sweatshop with no employees other than the stolen kids. Your crew sets the hideout afire, heads back to the village, and returns the children to their exultant parents. Though they can offer no reward but tears and smiles, your crew basks in the warmth of this priceless payment.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802141</GUID><Text>Shadow the kidnappers back to their hideout with a river skiff</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802145</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew navigates through the mangrove with aplomb.&lt;/b&gt; The unusual environment doesn't manage to stop their steady rowing, and the sailors soon reach an outpost marking the entrance of the bandits' camp. Sobbing children are taken from the kidnappers' steamboat, and dragged towards a distant barn. Half a dozen armed men guard the building.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802148</GUID><Text>Attack the bandits before they reach the barn</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802150</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The bandits don't know what hit them.&lt;/b&gt; Using the element of surprise to their advantage, your sailors break into the camp and stifle the children's escorts before they can call for help. They hush the kids, and squat behind what few bushes offer protection, monitoring the other bandits. The attack wasn't noticed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802152</GUID><Text>Go all out on the bandits and save the remaining children</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802154</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors and kids create a breathtaking chaos.&lt;/b&gt; The crew shoots and skewers, while the children kick and bite their former oppressors, calling for others to do the same. A deluge of shrieking kids and young adults emerge from the barn and attack the guards, thrilled by your crew's display of strength. The band of unlikely fighters seize the bandits' steamboat, helping themselves to its supplies, before triumphantly returning to the coast.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802155</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Audacity does not make up for their lack of numbers.&lt;/b&gt; The crew manages to take down five guards before the noise attracts more armed bandits, and the sailors are driven back to their boat before they can liberate any more children. They flee to the village, and share what they've discovered with the villagers, glad to have freed some kids, but all too aware that many more remain captive.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802153</GUID><Text>Acknowledge the danger, and leave with the children you've already saved</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802156</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The decision to run is not a simple one.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors recognize how dangerous the assault could be, and retreat to the village along with the few children they've saved. They share what they've discovered with the villagers - and maybe another day, with a subtler approach, more men, and more planning... things could be different. As the ship leaves, the crew focuses more on the good they did, rather than what they could have done.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802151</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors are unfit for a swift assault.&lt;/b&gt; Their unchoreographed clumsiness and dissonant roars drives their opponents back not because of their strength, but because of the unconventional display. After an instant of bafflement, the kidnappers shout for others to join them, and the whole gang soon surrounds your crew. They part to let their leader, a beast of a man, face the puny intruders.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802157</GUID><Text>Fight the brute</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802159</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors' cause fuels their victory.&lt;/b&gt; Driven by their will to save the children, your sailors do not waver in front of the bandits' leader, all muscles and swords with rage in his eyes. It takes six fighters to face the man, piling up on him in a torrent of dust and groans until he finally stops rampaging. Disheartened by this defeat, and their leader's meaningless pride, the remaining kidnappers are brought to their knees, and the children are freed. The crew returns to the village triumphant!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802160</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The mastodon tramples your sailors.&lt;/b&gt; The rescuers lack resistance, and are wiped out by the bandits' leader, their corpses sent flying among the children who can do nothing but watch in horror. In an ultimate act of hatred, a young girl is sent back to her village to retell the carnage, and warn future intruders against trying to rescue the children again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802158</GUID><Text>Run away</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802161</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No sailor is harmed, no child is saved.&lt;/b&gt; The crew manage to run back to the village, avoiding the multiple gunshots fired by the kidnappers. That no sailor was wounded is a miracle, but it's hard to celebrate much when the rescue team failed to rescue a single child.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802149</GUID><Text>Hide amongst the trees and wait for nightfall</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802162</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew becomes one with the trees.&lt;/b&gt; Unseen and unheard, the sailors bury themselves in the forest, and observe their future targets. An opportunity arises when a group of bandits leave their posts to bathe in the river: splashing and talking, they don't hear your men approach.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802164</GUID><Text>Steal their clothes to disguise yourselves as bandits</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802166</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors use their disguises to orchestrate the children's escape.&lt;/b&gt; Dressed in bandits' rough coats and sashes, the crew infiltrates the barn-turned-sweat-shop, where the children are forced to work. One by one, they lead the kids out of the camp and into their skiff, each child carrying stolen supplies. When the boat finally leaves, the camp is left without fuel, food, or ammunition. It will be some time before the bandits can do any more harm.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802167</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The poorly-disguised intruders are identified and given chase.&lt;/b&gt; When asked by an actual bandit about their shift, one of your undercover sailors tries to answer: they fumble and bumble until the bandit grabs them and shouts, "intruders!". They make a run for it with the others, leaving both kidnappers and children behind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802165</GUID><Text>Capture the men and use them as hostages</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802168</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A flawless move, from start to finish.&lt;/b&gt; After swiftly capturing the naked bandits, the sailors advance, only to discover the camp's true nature: a child-powered sweatshop. It's soon obvious that the bandits' leader is the only one who doesn't care for the hostages, and the man is forcibly exchanged by his crew in return for the promise that your sailors will never set foot in there again. The rescuers return to the village with children on their shoulders, a culprit to be judged, and goods to be shared.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802169</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The naked men overpower your fighters.&lt;/b&gt; The element of surprise fails to compensate for your crew's lack of strength, and they're easily repelled by the bathing bandits. Instead of killing them, the kidnappers order the sailors to strip, and send them on their way so everyone can see them for what they are - rescuers who were unable to rescue anyone, and who were humiliated in the process.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802163</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors are not attuned to the notion of stealth.&lt;/b&gt; They argue about the best place to hide, and end up lining up behind what could be the thinnest trees in the entire forest, their bulging shapes attracting more than a little unwanted attention from the kidnappers. Their leader, more beast than man, advances to inspect the intruders, and laughs at the puny men.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802170</GUID><Text>Face the brute</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802172</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew are puny indeed, and they are butchered.&lt;/b&gt; The bandits' leader needs no help in fighting your rescuers, who spend more time trying to avoid being hit than actually fighting back. They flee the camp, scatter into the woods, and are hunted down like game. The few sailors who make it back to the coast are so disoriented, they can't even remember the location of the kidnappers' camp, making the deaths of their companions pointless.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802146</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The terrain is not one your crew are used to.&lt;/b&gt; They get stuck in the mangrove roots, and their swearing can be heard all the way to the coast. When they manage to get free, the bandits' steamboat is waiting, its railings lined with guns.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802173</GUID><Text>Bluff and pretend backup is on its way</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802176</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your bluff works!&lt;/b&gt; The kidnappers have a heated discussion before handing over what few children they have onboard, unnerved by the menace your crew just invented. The sailors retreat to the village and return the children to their families, still amazed by their deception, but upset they could save so few.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802177</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They do not buy your bluff.&lt;/b&gt; Holding your crew at gunpoint, the bandits casually wait for the reinforcements to show up - but they never arrive. To teach your crew a lesson, the kidnappers grab one of the kids onboard, and cut his tongue before throwing it into your raft: a lesson to you liars. Your sailors withdraw to the village, regretting having only made things worse.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802174</GUID><Text>Attempt to buy the children</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802178</GUID><Text>The kidnappers smirk.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802179</GUID><Text>Okay</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802181</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A pricey but worthy trade.&lt;/b&gt; Trying to hide their distaste for treating children like goods, your sailors bring the kids onboard. They are in a state of shock, but they look physically sound.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802183</GUID><Text>The children are safe with you, punish their abductors</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802186</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your retribution is ruthless.&lt;/b&gt; The kidnappers are still counting up the goods you bought the children with when the crew attacks, and its assault is brutal. The steamboat is set aflame, and the bandits die by fire or bullet. The crew returns the kids to the safety of their homes, but the children now see them as no different from their captors: beasts, driven by violent instincts.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802187</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors are overpowered.&lt;/b&gt; The kidnappers have fought much harder battles against much lesser men, and your crew's attack is dismissed with scorn. The bandits could easily have retrieved the children, but their strange sense of honor makes them consider that goods bought are goods acquired. The crew are sent back to the village with the kids, both looking equally dishevelled and aghast.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802184</GUID><Text>The children will be safer with their parents, let the kidnappers leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802188</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A pity to let the culprits escape so easily.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors return the children to their respective families, but the kids' joy fails to hide how many more could have been saved given a little extra effort.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802180</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802189</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You don't meet the bandits' expectations.&lt;/b&gt; To teach your crew a lesson, the kidnappers grab one of the kids onboard and cut his thumb, tossing it into your raft: a lesson for the penniless. Your sailors withdraw to the village, regretting having only made things worse.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802175</GUID><Text>Let them be and leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802190</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's only so much your sailors can do.&lt;/b&gt; They back away under the menace of the bandits' guns, doing their best not to trigger an attack, and row back to the coast. The parents of the abducted children thank them for their effort, but their strangled hopes make their voices break. The sailors leave knowing they could have done better.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802147</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Rather than bandits, the crew finds their leftovers.&lt;/b&gt; The bayou's fog makes for a maze your sailors cannot navigate, causing them to lose their quarry. Disturbingly, while trying to find their bearings, your crew ends up making a discovery more harrowing than they could ever imagine: a pit filled both with torn shoes, and their torn young makers. The image stays with them until they try to describe it to the villagers and break down, unable to depict the young faces and their blank eyes. They leave, disgusted by their inability to end this savagery.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802142</GUID><Text>Stay on your ship and open fire when the steamboat appears</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802191</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A masterful shot!&lt;/b&gt; Using one of your precious spiral-muzzled cannons, the crew fires a single shot which pierces straight through the steamboat's engines. The boat gradually stops puffing and drifts to your own ship, where sailors can pick off the bandits, and retrieve the three stolen children.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802194</GUID><Text>Scare the kidnappers into revealing the position of their hideout</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802197</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your seafarers coerce the river-dwellers into speaking the truth.&lt;/b&gt; There is a world of knowledge and pain into your men's eyes, and the bandits are overwhelmed before a single word is spoken. Their hideout is easy prey for your crew, which storms through the den and triumphantly returns the children to their parents, along with the bandits' possessions and supplies.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802198</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The intention is there, but not the result.&lt;/b&gt; The bandits recognize your sailors for what they are: sharp-shooters, but weaklings when it comes to close-range confrontation. The crew's threats mean nothing to them. Knowing that these men are the only ones who know where the rest of the children are being held, your crew hands them over to the villagers along with the kids they found, and leave with a feeling of defeat.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802196</GUID><Text>Enough risks for today: return the children and be on your way</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802199</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Thoughts of the remaining captives follow your crew.&lt;/b&gt; The villagers are thrilled to have the handful of children returned to them and profusely thank their saviors, making the crew's remorse all the worse. The sailors are happy for them, but they know they could have done more.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802192</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Poor use of your firepower.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors handling the cannons are just as important as the weapons themselves. As your crew aren't quite as well-oiled as the machinery, they fail to adjust the quantity of powder being used, firing the artillery to its maximum range without any kind of aiming. They might as well have lit signal fires. The bandits' boat makes a brutal turn and retreats into the bayou at full speed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802201</GUID><Text>Shadow the kidnappers back to their hideout with a river skiff</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802193</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Both bandits and captives are killed.&lt;/b&gt; The villagers watch in horror as your ship fires its cannons at the small steamboat as soon as it is in sight, annihilating the frail vessel and all life onboard. Mothers and fathers rush to the water, screaming and crying as tiny bodies slowly emerge. If your crew had a greater control over themselves and the ship, maybe they wouldn't have had to bear the weight of these children's deaths.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802143</GUID><Text>Ignore the bandits and go on your way</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802200</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Not all sailors share your lack of compassion.&lt;/b&gt; Some men and women refuse to leave, and the officers have no choice but to let them do as they please lest they lose even more of the crew's trust. Many sailors argue that staying to help was the right choice, but the ship has already set sail when they voice their opinion.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802228</GUID><Text>The Deeper You Go</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802229</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A boulder-blocked entrance and a booby-trapped corridor: typical Mesoan temple.&lt;/b&gt; After a fall down a slide and a crash into uncharted caves, your team of explorers jokes about the situation in an attempt to forget its deathly aspect. They know what people say of Mesoan mazes: the deeper you go, the shinier it gets.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802230</GUID><Text>Follow the suggested route and progress through the traps</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802232</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The obvious traps are easily evaded.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors contort themselves to avoid sharp stones and plated triggers, flowing through the corridor with the ease of seasoned explorers or cutpurses. They quickly reach the pocket of the temple: a vast chasm crossed by a meager bridge with no handrails. Could this be a trial of courage?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802233</GUID><Text>Cross the run-down bridge</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802234</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You pass the trial!&lt;/b&gt; As they wave their arms to keep their balance, your sailors brush against ropes suspended around the bridge, hidden by a clever camouflage of paint and shadow play. They grasp the ropes to steady their footing, and a distant mechanism clicks. A rumbling door opens on the other side of the chasm, revealing the exit - and, on its threshold, a shiny artifact.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802235</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Nothing rewards your sailors' recklessness.&lt;/b&gt; It's unclear whether the bridge is shaking because of its own frailty, or because of your explorers' quivering legs. Soon the crew are on their knees, creeping across the moldy planks and begging for their mothers. They reach the other side without a scratch, save for their wounded pride, and find a tunnel which leads them outside after some more crawling.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802236</GUID><Text>Climb down the chasm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802237</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The climb is child's play.&lt;/b&gt; Rock walls provide a much steadier footing than wind-flogged masts. The sailors reach the bottom of the chasm, where they find an army of ropes stretching into the darkness above: the entrails of the temple's mechanisms! They find what might have been the Mesoan engineers' entrance, and leave the temple with filled pockets and memories.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802238</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew aren't as strong as they think.&lt;/b&gt; An officer loses her nerve and her grip, slipping down the stone, with a soft thud marking the end of her fall. Smooth slithering sounds hush her desperate cries. The floor is covered in snakes!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802239</GUID><Text>Find a way among the snakes</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802241</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors manage to flee.&lt;/b&gt; Too occupied by the convulsing mass of the fallen officer, the reptiles don't notice the furtive crew as they tip toes past them and escape through the first tunnel available. The explorers emerge outside the temple, stunned by their survival.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802242</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They cannot read the snakes' behaviour.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors progress across the wriggling floor, so focused on their movements that they don't see the mass of snakes backing away from them, and piling against the sole exit. The crew has no choice but to run into the tunnel before it ends up filled with snakes, and several sailors end up as reptile diner.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802240</GUID><Text>Scare the snakes away with torches</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802243</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew stand their ground as well as they can.&lt;/b&gt; The burning torches are swung before the snakes, forcing them back from the sailors. The officer is pulled to her feet and dragged with the rest of the crew through a windy tunnel, leading them outside, empty-handed, but safe.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802244</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What should the snakes be scared of, exactly?&lt;/b&gt; Your crew flap the torches around them in a ballet of shaking hands and dripping sweat, but fail to make even one step forward before a young sailor waves his torch past the limits of safety. The snakes leap on your crew, leaving none but a single witness alive.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802245</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The challenge demands more coordination than the crew has.&lt;/b&gt; Surprised by the brushing elbow of a comrade, a sailor squeals in terror and jumps back, triggering trap after trap of flying arrows, flaming oils, poison sprays. Once the most sensational traps have simmered down, the roof collapses and seals the exit, as sand slowly starts to fall from the walls.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802246</GUID><Text>Look for a hidden mechanism</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802249</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The patterns of the mechanism do not escape your hunters' probing.&lt;/b&gt; Upon close and cool-headed inspection, one the sand-spewing hourglass engravings appears to be protruding from the wall. The sailors smash the button, forcing the wall to open and reveal an exit. They flee from the sand, and the temple itself.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802250</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;If there is a mechanism, the crew cannot find it.&lt;/b&gt; Sand keeps pouring into the room, blinding the sailors as it forces its way into their noses and mouths. The explorers utter muted screams. As the sand packs up against the walls, one of them crumbles under the weight and lets the sailors spill outside of the temple: some alive, most dead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802248</GUID><Text>Try and find a weak wall to break</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802251</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The old wall caves in effortlessly.&lt;/b&gt; Following the sand pouring from the cracks, the explorers identify the wall from which most grains seem to be falling. They stave it in, causing a dusty outpour which fills their lungs, before clearing to reveal sunlight. They hasten through the self-made exit, and end up on the beach on which they'd left their ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802252</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The explorers bang on the walls helplessly.&lt;/b&gt; Sand keeps pouring into the room, ricocheting off the sailors, blinding them as it forces its way into their noses and mouth. The crew utters muted screams. As the sand packs up against the walls, one of them crumbles under the weight and lets the sailors spill outside of the temple: some alive, most dead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802231</GUID><Text>Create your own path and push the boulder away</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802253</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The boulder moves!&lt;/b&gt; The combined effort of the crew manages to lift the giant stone out of its socket. As the boulder rolls, a loud snap resonates and the rock bounces back into place. A wall falls behind the sailors and, in a concert of grating dirt and destroyed stone, it starts to advance towards the crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802255</GUID><Text>Push against the wall to stop it</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802257</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ancient wall cannot resist your crew's pressure.&lt;/b&gt; They grunt in unison and breathe in rhythm with their effort. One, two. The wall stops in its tracks. One. It shivers. Two. The wall crumbles, revealing a large opening under its railings: the crew finds the body of a less lucky adventurer, one hand clawing at the threshold of a gaping exit, the other gripping an oversized diamond.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802258</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The wall is unfazed by your crew's efforts.&lt;/b&gt; As an explorer gets to her knees to pray in the face of her imminent death, she notices an engraving much less elaborate than the temple's decorations: letters that have been scribbled in a language she can actually understand! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Crawling by day, airborne by night."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right underneath the scribbling are four buttons depicting animals.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802259</GUID><Text>Press the sloth</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802263</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Wrong answer.&lt;/b&gt; The brick above the button opens and an arrow flies into the crew, perforating the throat of a sailor, and leaving a red line in the cheek of the button-presser. The floor under the explorers tilts and they roll, a helpless mass of arms and legs which slides along the tunnel before being expelled outside the temple.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802260</GUID><Text>Press the bat</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802264</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Wrong answer.&lt;/b&gt; As she presses the button, the sailor feels no resistance, and keeps pushing the carved stone until her full arm is in the wall. She can feel something furry on her skin, a little bit rough, and a bit... She screams! As fangs dig into her flesh, a legion of bats emerge through the newly opened wall - and the only way out is through the bats' nest. The crew emerges from the temple covered in blood, and crippled with a lasting fear of the dark.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802261</GUID><Text>Press the butterfly</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802265</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Right answer!&lt;/b&gt; The sailor hits the butterfly button and celebrates as the wall stops advancing, and bricks whirl into the floor to form a staircase. The crew emerges from the temple, wondering about the intentions of whoever thought to carve such needlessly complicated riddles in their mother tongue.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802262</GUID><Text>Press the cockroach</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802266</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Wrong answer.&lt;/b&gt;As the cockroach is pressed, the insect shivers and shakes the dust off its shell. It's alive! The ceiling opens and a swarm of cockroaches flies into the room, aiming for the sailors' mouths. The crew smash the insects with whatever objects they have at hand, their horror giving them wings of their own, pushing them to climb the walls until they reach the outside.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802256</GUID><Text>Look for another way out</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802267</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The unfazed explorers rapidly find an exit.&lt;/b&gt; They notice how the floor's cobblestones move to let the advancing wall pass, and wait for the right moment to jump into the space between wall and floor. One by one, they land into the room below, where a large opening to the outside lets in the morning light, revealing a spectacle of spiderwebs surrounding a delicate piece of sculpted mahogany.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802268</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors do not find an exit.&lt;/b&gt; All stones look alike, and the crew lacks the ability to appraise which rock might be more important than the others. The advancing wall looms ever closer, ready to crush their bones, before suddenly leaning forward and pushing the sailors to the floor, which in turn opens to eject the explorers outside the temple. Yes, they are alive - but the very sight of a stone wall will scare them for years to come.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802254</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The boulder doesn't move.&lt;/b&gt; Your explorers push, nudge and thrust, but the exit stays sealed. They have no choice but to obey the maze's invitation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802470</GUID><Text>The Storm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802472</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;This tempest is beyond anything you have ever faced.&lt;/b&gt; The smell of salt is everywhere. The freezing water pierces everyone. The winds and waves hit your ship with impossible violence, making the vessel groan and tremble with each new strike, the air so full of sea-spray one could drown in it. Is there anything mere humans can do in the face of such godlike wrath?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802474</GUID><Text>Pray that the usual method will work and reef the sails</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802478</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Trust in your habits pays.&lt;/b&gt; Years of executing the same maneuvers have ingrained them into your crew's instincts. The sailors reef sail after sail despite the poor visibility - they do not need sight, for they are guided by the invisible hand of practice. Only the fore and aft sails are left to flail in the wind to keep a semblance of control over the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802481</GUID><Text>Sail through the storm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802483</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The vessel emerges from the storm, unscathed.&lt;/b&gt; The barren masts of your ship part the tempest as the crew maneuver its jib sails and the spanker, both ridiculously small pieces of cloth in the face of the storm's fury. Still, the maneuver magnifies the importance of these sails and allows you to masterfully skirt the storm, leaving the curtain of rain just as lightning begins to strike. Entranced, the crew contemplates how they managed to defy such a grand power.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802484</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Waiting would have been a better option.&lt;/b&gt; Though the force of training helped your crew reef the sails, it doesn't reveal how to navigate the furious tempest. Sailing with nothing but the jib sails and spanker is a feat no one on your ship is capable of. The vessel is tossed about helplessly, until the storm decides to calm down.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802482</GUID><Text>Wait for the storm to pass</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802543</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The storm passes.&lt;/b&gt; With the sails reefed to avoid damage, the sailors have only themselves to care about: they bury under the deck in wet bundles, shivering under the biting cold of the unremitting downpour. The endless wait is dispelled by a timid sun, and the expedition can finally resume.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802479</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What is faith in yourself against the rage of the heavens?&lt;/b&gt; The sails thrash against their mast, escaping the hands of your sailors as they desperately try to reel them in. The freezing rain becomes hail, and the crew's strength melts under the relentless pounding. About half the sails are secured as the first bolts of lightning crackle over the horizon.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802486</GUID><Text>Order the crew to finish reefing the sails</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802488</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Just in time!&lt;/b&gt; The lieutenants' preaching hits the sailors harder than the hail itself, and the crew pours their last drops of effort into reefing the remaining sail. As they finish attaching the spanker, the full strength of the tempest hits the ship. To the relief of the crew, the reefed sails take no damage, but the ship lurches helplessly, carried by the whims of the storm until it finally calms down.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802489</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's no courage in these cowards.&lt;/b&gt; Despite the repeated calls of the lieutenants and the urgency of the situation, the sailors stay frozen in the face of the thunderstorm, awed mice before a famished cat. You can beat them into life, or say your prayers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802490</GUID><Text>Threaten to flog them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802492</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The threat works.&lt;/b&gt; The perspective of a flogging somewhat outweighs the menace of the thunderstorm, and the sailors resume their work in a panic. The sails are reefed and secured right before the heart of the storm crashes into your ship. Letting the tempest haul you through the ocean is not a pleasant experience, but at least the sailboat didn't take any damage.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802493</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The threat of punishment is weak and unwarranted.&lt;/b&gt; Rendered distraught by the storm and unable to gather their wits, your lieutenants have no power over the crew. Your sailors are too busy saving their skins to mind orders, especially when given with so little conviction. Your ship is consumed by the tempest, chewed up, ground down and spat out. Its skeletal remains drift away from the storm.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802491</GUID><Text>Pray the storm will end</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802496</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your prayers are heard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"A thousand may fall at your side, &lt;br/&gt;Ten thousand at your right hand, &lt;br/&gt;But it will not come near you. &lt;br/&gt;You will only observe with your eyes, &lt;br/&gt;And see the punishment of the wicked."&lt;br/&gt;As your priest intones, perched atop the bow, so does the storm seem to soften. A miracle? When the skies clear, however, it would appear that some sailors were judged to be wicked.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802497</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The thunderstorm hits your ship with full force.&lt;/b&gt; Call it divine punition or pure coincidence, but the tempest gathers around the vessel, and hell begins. Lightning strikes the masts and tears through the sails, igniting brief fires that are immediately doused by the hail. The deck is water, the ship is a wave - and it crashes against the sea, again and again. When at last the first sunrays bless the sailboat, its shape is left torn and mangled.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802487</GUID><Text>Maneuver with what sails you have left</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802498</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;To safety!&lt;/b&gt; Maneuvering with only half your sails while facing oversized waves, pounding hail and incoming lightning is as difficult as it sounds. And yet the crew does it. Relying not on the sails, but on the ship's bilge keel and its keel-protecting apron, they spear through the wind without being driven sideways. The boat leaps over the trough of the waves, pushed by the raging force of the elements, offering as much resistance it can possibly can - until, at last, the tempest is left behind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802499</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A close call.&lt;/b&gt; Navigating with so few sails proves more difficult than expected, and the proximity of the thunderstorm makes the sea even wilder. The ship rolls among the gigantic waves, lifted and shifted by the whims of the tempest. The crew's maneuvers amount to choosing which less terrible wave they wish to crash into. When the storm recedes, the damage is somewhat acceptable.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802500</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Too slow.&lt;/b&gt; The crew's skills are limited to classic sailing, perhaps in a bit of bad weather, but not in a storm of this magnitude. And not on a ship with half its sails reefed, and the other half flailing in the gale. Ignoring the urgency of the free sails, the sailors try to maneuver the ship, and manage to present its full flank to the waves. The tempest gladly takes the offering. It crashes into the ship, tearing both sails and men from it, before spewing the remains into calmer seas.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802475</GUID><Text>Frenzied measures for frenzied times: open all sails and ride the storm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802501</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Riding the wild wind isn't dangerous enough for your crew.&lt;/b&gt; In a display of complete control over the ship, they somehow manage to find an invisible corridor of safe passage among the waves. The gales that should have torn the sails apart instead fill them, making the sailboat dance with a majesty at least as grand as the storm itself. Instead of leaving the tempest, the crew rides it until it calms down on its own, exhausted from carrying its new masters.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802502</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A move as wasteful as it was risky.&lt;/b&gt; Meek doesn't even begin to describe your sailors' approach: they deploy the sails in an incoherent manner, letting the wind take hold of the ship. The vessel yaws to one side, then to other, its rudder barely in contact with the water. A wave grabs a sailor and runs away with him. Any more of this, and the whole crew will follow!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802503</GUID><Text>Time the anchor's release to counterbalance the ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802507</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A bold move!&lt;/b&gt; Releasing the anchor right as the ship reaches an upright position and begins to yaw is the perfect timing to stop the chaotic rolling. The sailboat protests against the maneuver, trembling under the insistence of the waves, but obediently follows your crew's demands as they finally steer it away from the storm. Unnerved but alive, the sailors agree that they have seen and done enough risk-taking for the day.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802508</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A move too bold.&lt;/b&gt; Timing the anchor's release to the yawing of the ship takes more competence and composure than your crew can muster. The iron cross drops as the ship rolls to the opposite side and, instead of driving the ship back to a steady position, the anchor grinds against the flank, tearing planks and railings as it falls. The waves finish the job. When the storm finally recedes, the ship is adrift, its flank gutted.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802504</GUID><Text>Fill the bottom of the hold to keep it steady</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802509</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Safe and sound.&lt;/b&gt; Ignoring the battering rain as they navigate the pitching deck with skill, the sailors organise a human chain to store the upper deck's goods in the depths of the ship. The temporary ballast, accompanied by the human weight of the sailors, manages to lower the waterline and quells the ship's rolls. Hidden in the hull, and unable to do any more for their ship, the crew must wait for the storm to calm down on its own.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802510</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Mayhem.&lt;/b&gt; Disheartened by the enormity of the task, the sailors hardly listen to their lieutenants. Four crew members attempt to follow orders and unfasten the deck's supplies, only to have them roll away and slide across the deck as the ship pitches in the storm, knocking down sailors and pushing them overboard, before breaking the ship's railings and toppling its weakened masts. When the sun emerges, it reveals the emaciated silhouette of a ghost ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802476</GUID><Text>Use the steam engines to carefully follow the trough of the waves</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802511</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Slow and steady.&lt;/b&gt;Maybe too slow? Careful maneuvers keep your ship under favourable winds, and keep the menace of transverse waves at bay, but the storm shows no sign of relenting.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802513</GUID><Text>Overheat the engines to outrun the storm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802515</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A power stronger than the elements themselves.&lt;/b&gt; Through skillful manipulation of the engines, the crew pushes the machinery to its utmost limit; the screw propeller moving far beyond what human sight can perceive, propelling the steam ship with remarkable speed. The vessel breaks through the waves and away from the storm in a thrilling display of man-made might.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802516</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You should have been more patient.&lt;/b&gt; The crew cannot manage such a brusque change of pace, and their meager knowledge of the machinery is not enough to demand so much from the engines without paying an equivalent price. The ship vaults away from the storm in a cacophony of complaining metal and agonizing devices - when at last the tempest is gone, the engines require your immediate attention and repairs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802514</GUID><Text>Maintain a steady pace and let the storm push you off track</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802544</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A negligible change of course.&lt;/b&gt; Letting the storm push your ship as it pleases upsets the most hot-headed sailors, but those with an actual brain upstairs appreciate the prudent approach. When the storm recedes, the ship's slight change of course takes a full week to be corrected - a decent trade-off in exchange for your safety.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802512</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You would have been better off with a windjammer.&lt;/b&gt; Navigating the ship through the storm proves trickier than expected, and the navigators' lack of familiarity with steam ships shows as they rely on the sails to maneuver, despite the ship's peculiar lack of a middle mast. It doesn't take long for the ship to protest against the poor handling. It yaws, and a loud rumble erupts from the hull: the ballast has come unfastened!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802521</GUID><Text>Fasten the ballast back into place</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802523</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your prayers are heard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"A thousand may fall at your side, &lt;br/&gt;Ten thousand at your right hand, &lt;br/&gt;But it will not come near you. &lt;br/&gt;You will only observe with your eyes, &lt;br/&gt;And see the punishment of the wicked."&lt;br/&gt;As your priest intones, perched atop the bow, so does the storm seem to soften. A miracle? When the skies clear, however, it would appear that some sailors were judged to be wicked.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802524</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Too heavy, too dangerous.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors are ill-prepared to handle the massive basalt stones that act as ballast. They try to secure the stones in place, but the ship continues to pitch: their footing is unsteady, and the rocks are so, so heavy. A sudden yaw sends the basalt rolling into them, and your sailors are knocked down, crushed like clay figures. There is nothing more to be done but wait for the ire of the tempest to pass.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802522</GUID><Text>Make use of the steamship's sails to survive</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802525</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You run a pretty decent storm jib!&lt;/b&gt; Navigating the steam ship like a good old sailboat, the navigators rely on the sails alone to steady the ship's erratic movements, and strain the rudder this way and that. It is fearless! The gale hits the wet sails with all its might, inflating them to their limit, as the sudden force breaks the ship out of its pitching. The navigators seize the opportunity to escape the storm, to the delighted clamour of the crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802526</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Disaster.&lt;/b&gt; Proving once more how inept they are at navigating this ship, your sailors attempt that which should never be attempted: they try to go against the wind. As the ship twirls, a gale strikes it with full force, transforming its yaw into a full-length broaching. The masts plunge into the sea, and there is no more up or down, and no more sky or deck. Everything is water. When the seas drain away, allowing the ship to sway back into position, there is no trace of the sailors taken by the storm.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802477</GUID><Text>Overwork the steam engines to boldly escape the storm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802527</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A power stronger than the elements themselves.&lt;/b&gt; Through skillful manipulation of the engines, the crew pushes the machinery to its utmost limit; the screw propeller moving far beyond what human sight can perceive, propelling the steam ship with remarkable speed. The vessel breaks through the waves and away from the storm in a thrilling display of man-made might.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802528</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The delicate machinery is handled brutishly.&lt;/b&gt; Assuming that the engine's heat is directly proportional to the ship's speed, the engineer overheats the steamer and brings the boiler way over capacity. The temperature rises, the pressure swells and the metal quivers, until one of the engines explodes, killing the engineer on the spot.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802529</GUID><Text>Attempt to use the remaining engine without your engineer</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802531</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An unexpected turnaround.&lt;/b&gt; A sailor steps forward: she's spent the trip observing the engineer, she says, and thinks she can handle the machinery. The lack of other volunteers, frightened by the engineer's death, leaves her the only candidate. She handles the remaining engine with a notable, if amateurish skill, and the steam ship emerges from the storm in one piece. Still, several sailors whisper about the ill luck of letting a woman save them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802533</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;From bad to worse.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors have even less skill than the engineer who, let us insist on this point, died while trying to practise his specialty. The crew tries to push this thing and pull that other thing. The pieces of metal are kicked to the best of the crew's abilities, until the air pump's valve bursts open, filling the entire room with burning steam, and forcing the sailors outside. The valve must be closed, and a volunteer offers to face the miniature hell.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802534</GUID><Text>Forget engineering, and hope the Lord will protect the volunteer</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802537</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;If not skill, at least courage is rewarded.&lt;/b&gt; The volunteer rushes inside the engine room to close the leaking valve, screaming a Glory Be as the steam broils his skin. Both steam and storm recede once the valve is slammed shut, and the crew can take its time repairing the abused machinery. The volunteer spends the rest of the trip preaching the Lord's grace, his incessant sermon making the other sailors regret the tempest and its terrifying shrieks.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802538</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Hell indeed.&lt;/b&gt; Whether the volunteer lacked faith, or the Lord lacked attention, it is only for Him to know. The man enters the engine room and can hardly touch the leaking valve before the steam devours him whole, large blisters feeding on his flesh while the whistling valve covers his screams. There is no distinguishing the man's agony from the machinery's cries, and the door is hurriedly sealed shut. The inhumane shrieks continue to resound through the ship for the rest of the trip.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802536</GUID><Text>Insist on using your crafting wits, and protect him yourself</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802539</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The best of a spread of bad options.&lt;/b&gt; The volunteer penetrates the engine room wrapped in layers of wet cloths, as the crew provides ventilation by rapidly opening and closing the door, avoiding the steam with damp armour of their own. The man manages to close the valve, and the rest of the steam is evacuated in the same ridiculously plain manner. The immediate danger is avoided, and the crew wisely decides to avoid any more risk-taking, and wait for the storm to end on its own.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802540</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Don't you know when to stop?&lt;/b&gt; The sailor covers himself in damp cloths and enters the engine room, only for the steam to contaminate his wet armour with its insufferable heat. He springs from the room covered in blisters, a monster of molten skin which howls agony beyond human comprehension, his cries echoed by the tempest itself. The steam follows him out of the room, and burns all the sailors within its grasp, taking delight in the stolen flesh until it finally recedes, replete thanks to the stubbornness of the crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802530</GUID><Text>Shut off the engines and rely on your sails</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802541</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Audacious!&lt;/b&gt; Abandoning the steam engines, the crew focuses its efforts on using all available sails on the ship. The sailors may not have faced tempests this grand before, but they have crossed seas and braved oceans aboard all kinds of vessels: navigation is in their blood. They face the winds, ignore the waves, and lock the steering wheel into place, allowing the ship to stay steady until the storm passes. Not the most natural of solutions for a steam ship, but a good display of skill nonetheless.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802542</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Reckless!&lt;/b&gt; Attempting to face the tempest without the ship's main power source is folly, and the crew cannot handle the safety sails as well as they imagined. They try to face the waves to break their momentum, but the ship's mishandling lets it drift - and offers its flanks to the tempest. When the sun finally pierces the clouds, it reveals a spectacle of lacerated sails, flooded supplies, and disgruntled sailors.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802609</GUID><Text>The Mountain Maw</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802610</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors face the mountain without a map.&lt;/b&gt; After racing from guide to guide through the depths of the mountain range, the crew find themselves devoid of a chaperone: the guide supposed to take them on the last leg hasn't shown up at the time you agreed. Forget what initial goal you had in mind - getting off the snow-topped peak is the only priority now.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802611</GUID><Text>Traverse the mountain on your own</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802613</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your navigators make do without a guide.&lt;/b&gt; They take note of landmarks as they progress, relying on their compasses to follow a single direction, staying put during the night despite their dwindling supplies. At long last, they find a stream of melted snow, and follow it downhill to the foot of the mountain. The crew survived, but it was a tough effort.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802614</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A guide would have been helpful.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors navigate the mountain paths to the best of their ability, but they aren't skilled enough for the task at hand. The narrow roads disappear beneath the mist of the snow and branch out around the skeletal trees, forcing your crew to spread out. When the explorers reach a decent camping ground and count their numbers, five of them are missing.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802618</GUID><Text>Go forward, leaving marks for the lost sailors to follow</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802620</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The foot of the mountain, at last.&lt;/b&gt; The crew progress step by step, testing the frozen snow for gaps while leaving piles of stones for the lost sailors to follow. Building the landmarks takes time, but it helps avoid any backtracking. The main group is soon joined by the missing sailors, who are disgruntled at having been left behind, despite the crew's best efforts to guide them. Soon their ordeal is over, however, as they reach the end of the mountain range in silence, left speechless with relief.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802621</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The explorers get more lost with each passing day.&lt;/b&gt; They venture deep into the mountain and quickly abandon the idea of leaving marks for the lost sailors, too concerned for their own survival. The frost solidifies their clothes, steals their toes and rots their food.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802622</GUID><Text>Follow a stream of melted snow running downhill</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802625</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors manage to follow the stream to the foot of the mountain.&lt;/b&gt; The stream flows in and out of the frozen ground, playing hide and seek with the desperate crew. They are not the only ones using the trickle as a guide: just before reaching the plains below the mountain, they meet with the missing sailors, who are quenching their burning thirst in the meagre snow stream. It's unclear which of the two teams is the most pitiful, but all are alive.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802626</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Where did they come from? Where should they go?&lt;/b&gt; The melting snow splits into a web of entangled streams, which buries under the ground and resurfaces without any apparent logic. The crew are taken by the illusion that the forest around them is flat, and can no longer tell if they are climbing or descending. They split like the streams themselves, to each sailor their trickle - but like the streams, not all of them find the foot of the mountain.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802623</GUID><Text>Force your way through the mounds of powder snow</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802627</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors draw strength from their last resources.&lt;/b&gt; They ignore the colossal distance they have to cross, and focus on small milestones instead. Two steps to that tree. Three steps to that rock. The snow parts as they advance, drawing dark trenches which run across the pure white mantle, and which eventually - finally - reach the foot of the mountain. The crew stumble and fall in relief when they realise they made it out alive.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802628</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors are too weakened by the cold.&lt;/b&gt; They dig through the powder snow, only for it to collapse in again without revealing any safe path. Their endurance crippled by the frost, they abandon the task and try to focus on less demanding options.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802624</GUID><Text>Prioritise your supplies and look for food</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802629</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew extend their stay in the cold to gather supplies.&lt;/b&gt; Game is scarce, and hunting takes time. However, the food makes for a decent meal, and the smell of roasted hare fills the sailors' stomachs almost as well as the meat itself. The light from the fire spreads through the forest at night, and beckons the missing sailors. Reunited, the crew avoid talking about abandoning their companions, and they leave the mountain in silence.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802630</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your hunters fall prey to the mountain.&lt;/b&gt; Animals' tracks sprinkle the fresh snow, but their owners are invisible, hidden in holes and burrows. The hunters are unused to such terrain. As they progress through the forest, discussing where snares could be most efficient, the frozen ground suddenly breaks beneath them, and a handful of sailors fall into a deep fault.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802619</GUID><Text>Go back and look for the missing sailors</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802631</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The missing sailors are found, and with them an exit.&lt;/b&gt; The idea of losing their companions pushes the hunters to persevere. Broken twigs, brushed moss, mud splashes: everything is a hint. They follow the trail to a crossing and find the lost sailors, who welcome them heartily: better yet, they've found a beaten path which leads straight to the foot of the mountain! That they believed in the others and waited for them is a reward in and of itself.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802632</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The fresh snow hides the dangers underneath.&lt;/b&gt; A powdery white frosting covers everything in sight, and the skies melt into the ground, disguising the horizon. The hunters advance on instinct alone, unable to spot any hints of their previous passage. They find the missing sailors only by encountering the same fate: the frozen ground breaks under their weight. The thin crust of ice hid a fault! Three of the lost men are down there - and two hunters just joined them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802633</GUID><Text>Pull the sailors from the fault, at the risk of falling</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802637</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The rescue comes at the price of their remaining strength.&lt;/b&gt; It takes ten sailors to get one man out of the fault: three to pull, six to hold and one to keep an eye on the trembling layer of ice. The snow weighs them down, pushing when they pull, hissing when they call out. When the last sailor is hauled from the rift, both the rescuers and rescued are broken. They drag themselves downhill. and manage to leave the clutch of the mountain.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802638</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ordeal is much bigger than your sailors.&lt;/b&gt; They launch ropes into the rift, but the slippery walls of ice cannot be climbed. The rescuers attempt to haul the others up, and they plant their feet into the ground, pulling, heaving and panting, their physical reserves long drained by the cold. As they fall to their knees and break their nails on the frozen hemp, the rift cracks, and the mountain opens its mouth wide. The crewmates it swallows are never seen again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802634</GUID><Text>Abandon them and continue downhill</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802639</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Salvation at the price of their humanity.&lt;/b&gt; Ignoring the begging screams of their companions, the sailors make a large detour to avoid falling into the frozen rift. As they find a beaten path heading downhill, a sailor catches up to the group, panting: he admits to having thrown some pickaxes and ropes down the fault. The crew congratulate him for his selflessness, and pretend his good deed is enough to ease their conscience.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802612</GUID><Text>Retrace your tracks</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802640</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The path is easy to recognize, but it is tortuous and unforgiving.&lt;/b&gt; The crew fight against the elements, hurrying through the mountain passages with haste, lest their tracks disappear and leave them without hints to follow. When they finally escape the mountain range, they cannot remember how many nights they spent walking, and how many days they spent starving.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802642</GUID><Text>Blood, Oil, Sweat and Tears</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802643</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An overweight ship is easy prey for stormy waves.&lt;/b&gt; The oil merchants your crew met at the last harbour paid good money for their cargo to be stored aboard your ship, but the weight isn't really something your vessel can handle. At the first signs of tempest winds and cutting waves, the unusual ballast makes your ship heel furiously.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802644</GUID><Text>Release the stern anchor</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802646</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Safe.&lt;/b&gt; The cast-iron shank of the anchor plunges into the shifting waves with a large splash, the amount of chain being just right for it to take a good hold of the seabed. The ship wobbles, washed by the winds and the waves, but manages to stay put. The sailors simply wait for the storm to pass, and hope the extra load will not cause any more problems.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802647</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A miss - the crew should go hide in the lower decks.&lt;/b&gt; The anchor is released, its chain unravelling by itself more than it is controlled, and the large iron cross reaches the bottom with too much play to properly grip the sea floor. As it becomes apparent the anchor won't be of any help, the lieutenants order the crew to descend to the bottom decks of the swinging ship - but the oil merchants refuse to leave the apparent safety of their upper cabins.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802648</GUID><Text>Take the time to present this solution as the best</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802650</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The lost time was necessary.&lt;/b&gt; Your lieutenants carefully convince the merchants, detailing all available options one by one, despite the increasingly high pressure from the waves, and the rocking of the ship. Their stoicism more than their arguments convinces the merchants to follow the orders, and they join the rest of the crew on the lower deck until the storm comes to pass.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802651</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A waste of time.&lt;/b&gt;Pressed by the urgency of the situation and unable to get their thoughts in order, your lieutenants cannot properly convince the merchants. As they begin to lose their nerve, the ship swerves and slams into the shore. Whistling winds invade the perforated hull, and water seeps in its wake.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802652</GUID><Text>Repair the hole while the water is still pouring</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802654</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew are used to making repairs in poor conditions.&lt;/b&gt; Ignoring the swinging floor, the sailors focus on the hull, their legs deep in the pouring water. Drenched supplies lap around their legs as they fight to plug the hole. The seal will not last long, but it should hold until the next harbour.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802655</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew's speed cannot match the water's.&lt;/b&gt; Overwhelmed by the current, and unable to prioritise their tasks or even shape a plan for the repairs, the sailors quickly abandon the idea of patching up the hull. They flee to the upper deck, and brace themselves as the ship crashes on the shore. The repairs take weeks.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802653</GUID><Text>Move the ballast to lift the hole above sea level</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802656</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The forced instability protects the ship.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors huff and puff as they push the large sacks of basalt stones across the belly of the ship, progressively tipping the vessel's balance until its pierced flank leans away from the water. The ship is carefully led to the shore, where the crew can finally start repairs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802657</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A ludicrous plan.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors wheeze and gasp as they try to pull the basalt sacks, but their efforts are not enough to make the ballast budge. The ship remains level, allowing more and more water in, as it sinks under the intrusion. Several sailors drown, trapped between the deck's roof and the swirling currents, and their bodies cannot be evacuated before the storm calms down.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802649</GUID><Text>Drug them to avoid losing any more time</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802658</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Safe and drunk.&lt;/b&gt; The merchants accept the liquid courage and drink its laced contents, falling asleep before they can finish their bottle. They're dragged to the lower deck along with the rest of the crew and whatever supplies the sailors could carry, their combined weight counterbalancing the pounding of the waves. The storm soon calms down, leaving the crew to deal with the hangover of their passengers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802659</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Too weak.&lt;/b&gt; The drinks your sailors offer the merchants in an attempt to soothe their anger are far too poorly made to have any kind of impact on them. As they continue to struggle against your crew, a vivid growl resonates through the ship. You came too close to shore, and the reefs have pierced your hull! Water starts to pour into the lower decks.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802645</GUID><Text>Improvise a sea anchor on the surface of the water</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802660</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sea anchor works as intended.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors quickly cable up a weighty assemblage, and after fastening it securely, let it drop into the waves. It pulls against the water to increase the ship's drag, gaining it enough stability to keep its broadside away from the waves. The crew, relieved, can wait for the storm to pass.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802661</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sea anchor sinks as soon as it touches the water.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors tack together some extra sails to try and assemble a sea anchor, but the ballooning cloths snap as soon as they're thrown into the waves. As the ship is pushed towards the shore, the backwash gets more and more ample, until a rogue wave of ludicrous proportions rises above the sea. The merchant passengers beg your crew to save them!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802662</GUID><Text>Face the wave head on</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802665</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Fearless.&lt;/b&gt; Despite the battering gale and clobbering currents, your crew manage to keep the ship straight, as you face the rogue wave head on. The wave crashes into your vessel with all its rage and natural power, but the straight bow cuts its fury in two, and the ship avoids most of the damage - a rock among the waters. When the storm calms down, your crew focus on the repairs, and consider how exceptional their survival was.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802666</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Too audacious.&lt;/b&gt; The gusts of wind fill your sails, and the frantic currents pull at your hull. Your crew are far too untrained to keep control over the ship. Entailed by the sea's passion, the ship leaps and falls, dancing until the shore catches it and stops its mad waltz. The vessel's carcass finally remains still, as water and bodies flow from its bent silhouette.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802664</GUID><Text>Throw the oil cargo overboard to calm the seas</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802669</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The water's anger dies out!&lt;/b&gt; Moving the merchants aside with ease and dismissing their plea, your sailors heave the oil barrels over the railings, and let their contents spill around the ship. The oil hugs the water and rolls over the waves, dissolving the wind's grip, and slowing the water's movement. The threat of the waves is no more, but the merchants' trust and cargo were lost in the process.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802670</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Their greed overcomes your strength.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors first try to reason, and then try to force the merchants into giving up their precious oil, but your crew are weak in both body and spirit, while the merchants built their fortunes on hard-headedness. Long after the ship has been hit, crushed, and stranded, the merchants's cadavers are found lying on the shore's pebbles, still clutching their barrels of cargo.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803304</GUID><Text>Good Whale Hunting</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803305</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"The whales are still around us!"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impossibly large trails of water break the wake of the ship, and the froth parts to reveal dark, leathery skin.

The crew salute their captain's skill, and revel in the moment.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803310</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Hard to avoid what you cannot see.&lt;/b&gt; The whales are everywhere: on the sides, in front, at the back, and beneath the ship. The captain strains against the limits of his skill, but he cannot avoid the impacts coming from below, and part of the cargo is sent flying before the ship can escape.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803311</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A school of whales is not a road you can simply navigate.&lt;/b&gt; As the ship shifts to the side, the closest whale reacts to the sudden movement by playing dead: it stops swimming, and lets itself fall at an agonizingly slow speed. The impact with the rudder is brutal, and bends the vital mechanism.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803312</GUID><Text>Attack! Harpoon the closest animal</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803313</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A feat of strength for a gratuitous kill.&lt;/b&gt; The harpoon impales the leading whale, and the rest of the school collides with its body, their advance being suddenly, and brutally stopped. The ship leaves without a scratch.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803314</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The harpoon strikes a calf, causing the school to attack.&lt;/b&gt; The wounded whale swirls to try and get rid of the iron rod, and its elders surround it, pushing the ship away from their young. The boat lists heavily to the side, and several men fall overboard.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803315</GUID><Text>Throw a roped harpoon to save the drowning sailors</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803316</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A harpoon is sacrificed to rescue the men.&lt;/b&gt; The men grab the harpoon's anchoring rope and climb back on board, just in time to see the rope snap and fall into the abyss. The ship flees before any whales resurface.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803317</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The rescue harpoon triggers the whales' attack.&lt;/b&gt; The roped weapon could have made a good rescue device, but the giant marine mammals were already restless from the previous throw. A whale simply tilts up its head, and a massive wave engulfs the drowning sailors, crashing against the ship, and ramming it away from the begging and screaming men.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803318</GUID><Text>Get away from the flustered whales</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803319</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The fate of the drowning men is sealed.&lt;/b&gt; As the ship retreats from the whales, the captain prays aloud for the sailors' survival.

A tale of dancing whales will be part of this expedition's story!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803322</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The performance's efficiency is questionable.&lt;/b&gt; Trying their best to be in unison, the sailors shout their hearts out more than they sing, and the underwater creatures don't seem to care. The group screaming occupies the crew for a long time, allowing the ship to drift closer to the school of whales.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803323</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew embarrass themselves.&lt;/b&gt; The underwater whales cannot hear the sounds squirming from the ship, and it's for the best. Dejected, their ears ringing, the sailors blame each other for the performance, and the team's unity and pride are deeply dented. Getting squashed by a whale would have been a better option.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803324</GUID><Text>Send a man in the diving bell to fix the rudder</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803325</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailor has rarely worked with such a view.&lt;/b&gt; As the hours disappear while he fixes the rudder, the whales continue their inexorable advance in a vision of lethargic, yet grandiose movement. When the rudder is repaired, the whales are still passing by - and too close for comfort.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803332</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The diving bell's rope tightens, then floats back up.&lt;/b&gt; Both equipment and sailor are lost to the unfathomable depths and their gigantic inhabitants. The crew ponders whether the accident was caused by chance, or animal malevolence.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803335</GUID><Text>Fire canons in the water to scare the whales away</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803336</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The tiny cannonballs somehow drive the massive creatures away.&lt;/b&gt; As the sea foams and whitens under the force of the impacts, it hides what reaction the whales may have. When the froth clears, the animals seem to have dived away from the ship, but the men stay tense for a long while.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803337</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Ten pound cannonballs against creatures of a hundred tons?&lt;/b&gt; A whale slams into the ship, then another one, then another. The repetitive impacts make the crew believe the attacks are intentional, and they rally into begging prayers and whimpers. When the ocean's fury recedes, they're left to count the sailors thrown overboard.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803338</GUID><Text>Wait for the whales to leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803339</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The whales are not eager to retreat.&lt;/b&gt; Used to being a predatorless presence, a whale shoves aside the obstacle in its way, and the ship is sent rocking.

Escorting Mr. Cardinale to the site of his rainforest opera house now seems all the more preposterous! The great patron of the arts twizzles his moustache in frustration! Apart from braving the difficulty ahead, only traversing a nearby hill might reconnect the expedition with the upper river.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800314</GUID><Text>Use your gunboat to navigate the shallows</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800318</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The design of the gunboat is vital to your success.&lt;/b&gt; Being of moderate size, and yet possessing the manoeuvring capabilities of a much smaller ship, the gunboat is able to navigate the awkward river shallows with ease. Mr. Cardinale is delighted that you have delivered him to the site of his proposed Opera House, and promises to talk favourably of each and every man when he returns to civilisation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800315</GUID><Text>Have the ship transported over the hill to rejoin the river further up</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800319</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'What a champion performance!' squeals Mr. Cardinale,&lt;/b&gt; from the comfort of his cushioned chair. The great ship seems to swim up and over the hill. The long timbers on which it rolls, and corkscrew winches at intervals up the slope work perfectly. 'I shall put in a good word for you all at the club,' promises Cardinale, as the ship splashes down safely on the other side. The men are immensely proud of the miracle they have performed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800320</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Getting a ship over a hill is mad, but it works.&lt;/b&gt; 'Is this absolutely necessary?' muses Mr. Cardinale, having watched the crew slip for a week in mud. But the rolling timbers and makeshift winches they have crafted prove adequate, and the ship finally scrapes down the other side, into the upper river. Mr. Cardinale barely offers a word of thanks, perturbed perhaps, by the indignity of it all.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800321</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There simply aren't enough materials&lt;/b&gt; to conduct such an elaborate enterprise.

It has taken a long enough after all.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800326</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is all going so well,&lt;/b&gt; this mad idea, with winches and cables scarcely sufficient for the task. But exertion eventually tells. As the ship rocks over the crest of the hill, there is not enough to keep it there, and it hurtles wildly down the other side. It is lucky the ship is not swept away in the river current. Still, it sustains significant damage from impact with the trees.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800327</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'I think it's going to give way!'&lt;/b&gt; cries the terrified Mr. Cardinale. The feet of your men slip and slide on the slope, as the unholy weight of the ship overcomes the winches, and it plummets back down the hill.

With water drawn, filtered and boiled, the crew can be sure it is safe to drink. Time even for a mud bath - your safari brigade slopping about like happy hippo.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801071</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The water still has a mighty pong&lt;/b&gt;, despite all solids having been separated out by the rudimentary device. Several feel terribly ill after drinking.

That takes brains. High above the dry basin, water piles blissfully into the gully. The men wouldn't miss a swim beneath a waterfall for the world!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801074</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's water, if you can get to it.&lt;/b&gt; Hippos are gathered all along the bank.

The serenity of the river bank is utterly destroyed, but none of your crew care, as they help themselves to bucketfuls of clean and highly quaffable drinking water.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801083</GUID><Text>Approach the water cautiously</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801088</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Someone knows their hippopotami.&lt;/b&gt; A kinship with the animals allows the gentle river bank to be shared. Fresh water is relayed by the bucket. A few nervous moments as a large female rears out of the water, but she just wants a bird to pick her teeth. Satisfied, the crew resume their trek to the rendezvous.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801089</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's movement in the hippo camp&lt;/b&gt;, as the crew approach, followed by violent evacuations of their gigantic nostrils.

The crew have lost half a day's march on the rendezvous, for a bit of muddy water.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801104</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A waste of time.&lt;/b&gt; The hippos leave at dusk to graze. Unfortunately, their patch is just a stone's throw away. Their aqueous eyes can be seen glistening in the moonlight, and no-one wants to risk it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801075</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Following a river should have been easy.&lt;/b&gt; But your party are so focused on distant goals, they fail to look immediately ahead. Suddenly, a man shoots downward as if yanked by giant hands. There are holes everywhere - an underground system of caves, and a tomb for your unlucky crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801068</GUID><Text>Press on to the rendezvous</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801076</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There was never enough water for all of them.&lt;/b&gt; A freak mist has the crew licking air with cracked tongues, but nothing can keep the wolf from the door. Several drop dead as old bone, before the safari staggers to the rendezvous camp.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801587</GUID><Text>Sunken Depths</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801588</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Unusual debris floats among the waves.&lt;/b&gt; Mold-ridden planks of wood, strings of cloth, fragments of broken plaster, all tinted by the grey shade of time. Filled with childish excitation, the crew discusses the possibility of going underwater to uncover the debris' origin.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801589</GUID><Text>Send your diver into the depths</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801592</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The diver plunges into the ocean with fish-like ease.&lt;/b&gt; He follows the trail of debris through the murky waters and almost smacks into a wall of indescribable height. Unsure whether the obstacle is natural or man-made, the diver wanders along its smooth facade until he finds an uncanny artefact and resurfaces with it. His account of the underwater mystery fascinates the crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801590</GUID><Text>Improvise a diving bell</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801593</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The diving bell looks decent and feels solid.&lt;/b&gt; Two men climb aboard and the bell plunges into the depths while a whole group of sailors pumps air into its ventilation tube. The bell descends until it is stopped by a surface of coral. Underneath the colorful shapes, the sailors notice a silver coin on their left and a gaping, perfectly circular hole on their right.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801595</GUID><Text>Hope that it will resist the dive and push the bell into the hole</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801597</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Their trust in the work of their comrades pays.&lt;/b&gt; The bell slithers in a slow fall which allows the bewitched divers to take in the view. This is no sunken ship: the engraved hole was a window among a hundred more lining a hall of ridiculous proportions. A single ray of light, pouring from the hole, accompanies the bell's descent until it lands on what might have been statue alcoves. A shining green pearl lies in the lowest part of the alcove.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801599</GUID><Text>Ignore the pearl and risk the dive into darkness</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801601</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Call it luck or miracle, but the bell holds.&lt;/b&gt; One of the men lights the bell's lamp and the other dives, following the glow as it illuminates the silent scene below: ghostly statues of hunting scenes, collapsed frescoes depicting plentiful gardens, and a massive throne of fractured marble on which a sword waits, covered in fluttering kelp. When the artifact is brought back to the surface and cleaned up, it reveals a weapon of exquisite quality, embedded with unknown jewels and metals.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801602</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Lady Luck does not smile for the faithless.&lt;/b&gt; As the bell descends into the dark, so does the pressure rise and press against the makeshift protection. The sailors pull the signal rope in a panic, but despite their fervent prayers, they are not pulled up in time. All that the crew manages to retrieve from the sea are the broken bell and its broken contents.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801600</GUID><Text>Retrieve the pearl from the dead-end and resurface</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801603</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The pearl is made of pure jade!&lt;/b&gt; The crew marvels at it and all want to touch it, feel it, smell it. The pearl spreads a nostalgic fragrance of salt water, fresh moss and damp stones, and the sailors agree this might be the very smell of adventure.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801598</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The bell doesn't resist the fall.&lt;/b&gt; Instead of gliding along the sides of the hole, the bell tilts, letting the water in. The men call for help and the crew immediately tries to pull them up, fighting against what rocks snare the bell, doing their best to save their mates, and unable to react when the rope snaps into their hands. They are left to mourn their sea-buried companions.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801596</GUID><Text>Pick up the coin and resurface</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801604</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Low risk, low reward.&lt;/b&gt; The diving bell emerges without a scratch and the crew enjoys the tiny silver coin, passing it around and commenting on its singular aspect. Their excitement can only survive for so long and the coin is stored in the officers' coffers while the sailors whisper what ifs leading to grander treasures.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801594</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The homemade diving bell falls apart.&lt;/b&gt; The engineers, specialized in complex ship machinery, have no idea how to make such a simple device. Their machine departs with two men onboard, and they continue to dive while the bell itself stays afloat. When the divers emerge, the engineers take an earful, and the crew are too disheartened to make a new attempt.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801591</GUID><Text>Ignore the beckoning junk</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801605</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors protest but understand the risk.&lt;/b&gt; As the ship goes on its way, its wake drowns the singular ruins and their promise of adventure.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802000</GUID><Text>A Crack in the Hull</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802002</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Water in the hull!&lt;/b&gt; The overloaded ship could only go so far with this many supplies in its belly. A series of strong waves sends the crates flying, and the boat's stomach soon explodes. Cracks pierce the hull where the cargo hit, and trickles of water pop one after the other throughout the storage space.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802003</GUID><Text>Use the electric water pump to allow proper repairs</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802006</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Specific situations call for specific solutions: your preparation was on point.&lt;/b&gt; The electric pump roars and swallows water much faster that it can infiltrate the ship, allowing the sailors to repair the damage with ease.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802004</GUID><Text>Improvise a water pump to allow immediate repairs</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802007</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crafty crew has a solution for everything.&lt;/b&gt; Using communication tubes as the pump's body, and spare metal sheets as paddles, the sailors manage to assemble what could pass for a proper water pump. It takes a good dozen men to make it work, but they buy enough time for proper repairs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802008</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;This joke of a pump looks like it came from the Dark Ages.&lt;/b&gt; As the sailors battle to have their own idea of a pump prevail over the others, they assemble a monster that does nothing more than blow bubbles. One of the cracks in the hull bursts in a spray of water, silencing the machine as the ship starts to flood.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802016</GUID><Text>Throw supplies overboard to try and lift the crack above the waterline</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802010</GUID><Text>Seal the overflowing section, regardless of what - or who - might still be inside</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802011</GUID><Text>Make a decision! Who knows what'll happen if you don't!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802017</GUID><Text>Okay</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802012</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ship rises in the water, but at what cost?&lt;/b&gt; The sailors watch their supplies drift away from the vessel, their hearts lingering after the lost items, until the officers remind them of the urgency of the repairs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802018</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802013</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's nothing more to be done.&lt;/b&gt; The ship slowly sinks, pulled deeper into the water with each new fracture in its hull. Both cargo and crew are drenched by the leaks, and the ship vomits their remains when it crashes onto the shore. The survivors contemplate the wreckage in despair, before trying to make repairs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802014</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Both cargo and crew are doomed to drown in the leakage.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors close the hull's doors on their comrades, hushing their screams. However, there's no avoiding reopening the hull when time comes for repairs: the water flows out, carrying bodies transfixed with expressions of suffocation, terror, and betrayal.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802005</GUID><Text>Seal the damaged section and repair it at the next harbour</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802015</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The drowned cargo cannot be salvaged.&lt;/b&gt; When the ship finally finds a harbour, its hull sits so far below the waterline your crew fears the boat will sink. Although such fears are unfounded, the leaks ruined a good part of your stored food, and the repairs feel like they should have be done much earlier.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800503</GUID><Text>The Singular Case of the Midshipman</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800504</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Midshipman is found with his throat slit, knife in hand.&lt;/b&gt; It would appear to be suicide, but appearances often prove deceptive. Understandably, the whole crew crowd the scene, debating whether he was the type to take his own life, or if someone might have gained by his passing. Needless to say, they expect some action be taken...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800506</GUID><Text>The Expert will have the answers</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800509</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There are gasps of macabre delight,&lt;/b&gt; as the famous detective reveals the only possible solution. 'Elementary you see. Look at this tiny moth wing on the body. Moths are drawn to light, and the sole light this night past issued from... this man's LANTERN!!' The detective lunges across the deck and secures the watchman, who being as impressed with the deduction as everyone else, readily admits to having sought to gain rank by the murder.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800507</GUID><Text>Commence an investigation</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800510</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Careful analysis of the scene&lt;/b&gt; reveals two leads. Some believe an autopsy would leave the facts of the case plain, while others reckon the little time available should be spent analysing any evidence at the scene that might establish whodunnit.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800512</GUID><Text>Conduct an autopsy of the body</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800514</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The autopsy is conducted very capably,&lt;/b&gt; and confirms the midshipman took his own life. A severe tumour is also discovered on the midshipman's brain. A letter, found later, serves to explain that the fellow knew he hadn't long to live, and wished to face death in his own way. The crew are galvanised on hearing this story of bravery.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800515</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The autopsy is sufficient to confirm it was murder.&lt;/b&gt; Strangulation was the cause of death, not a slit throat - which was added post-mortem. All else remains unknown. Nevertheless, with the cause of death established, the list of suspects is narrowed down to just a few who had the means and the motive for the crime.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800517</GUID><Text>Interrogate until someone confesses</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800519</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You out the grim truth.&lt;/b&gt; The alibi of one sailor does not match his fellows, and he cracks, confessing to the midshipman's murder. It transpires the midshipman had bragged of bedding the other man's wife. The murderer expresses only remorse for his crime, and as the noose is placed around his neck, the crew regret that justice must be so severe.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800520</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The interrogation is painfully haphazard.&lt;/b&gt; Though it is clear one of the suspects must be the killer, lines of inquiry fail to produce answers. No option remains but to offload all the suspects at the next port to prevent further incident. It is a source of great shame to the crew that fine innocent sailors are certain to be among them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800518</GUID><Text>Beat out a confession</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800521</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A brutal approach, but one delivering quick results.&lt;/b&gt; It seems the midshipman was preparing to whistle-blow unauthorised smuggling below deck, and was killed for it. The ringleaders threatened others with a similar fate if they didn't keep quiet. The culprits are unceremoniously shot, and the vulgar matter is over.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800522</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Torture seldom results in happiness.&lt;/b&gt; Your victim screams a confession, perhaps in the hope it will end the pain. With nothing else to go on, you scapegoat the poor beggar, and he is keelhauled until dead. The crew are in no doubt that this was the wrong man, and hope to escape your inhuman expedition at the first opportunity.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800516</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The autopsy is dreadfully clumsy,&lt;/b&gt; and leaves the body almost unrecognisable. The unschooled 'medic' evidently have a point to prove, and insist on defiling it further, despite being a bundle of nerves. By the end the morgue looks like a butchery, and the stricken mortician runs wildly about the ship, scalpel in hand. Several are injured trying to restrain him, but the psychological trauma of an unsolved mystery is twice as damaging.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800513</GUID><Text>Fashion a tool for gathering forensic evidence</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800523</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What innovation!&lt;/b&gt; A bright young spark applies some of the latest forensic researches. The knife used to cut the midshipman's neck is placed inside an airtight box along with vapours belonging to the doctor. As if by magic, when removed, clear sets of fingerprints appear on the shaft! When the crew prints are taken, the guilty party is collared in the most satisfying modern fashion!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800524</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's complicated&lt;/b&gt; identifying footwear and gait. Ambitious of the crew, then, to attempt to solve both problems with the one device. Still the notched stick-wheel does prove footprints at the scene are suspicious, and that suspects are limited to just a few matches. But how to get to the bottom of this?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800526</GUID><Text>Let there be a trial</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800529</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The trial goes as well as can be expected.&lt;/b&gt; The suspects are cross-examined, and proceedings recorded with quill and ink. The shoe-prints belong to a solemn old gent, whose testimony reveals him to be the midshipman's secret lover - the reason he was unforthcoming. He confirms the dead man intended suicide from guilt at their relationship, and was trying to prevent it, but arrived too late. All are grateful that the truth is finally out.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800530</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The trial is a farce.&lt;/b&gt; Sailors bark questions from the sidelines which the suspects are quite within their rights to leave unanswered. But this obstinacy serves only to rile the shouting mob! They flood through the makeshift courtroom and carry the suspects kicking and screaming to deck, before tossing them over the side.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800527</GUID><Text>Put the fear of god into the suspects</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800532</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's almost like divine intervention.&lt;/b&gt; The priest hears each suspect alone, and once the god-fearing killer breaks down and confesses, he is handed his rope. Still, a lack of forgiveness does not trouble the crew, who are relieved this ungodly chapter is now closed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800533</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;These are not god-fearing sailors,&lt;/b&gt; and hear the priest's weak plea for the killer to come forward with impassive expressions. Perhaps there is a different approach.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800528</GUID><Text>Dump all the suspects at the next port, and be done with it</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800534</GUID><Text>The Singular Case of the Midshipman</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800525</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Fragile justice!&lt;/b&gt; As your craftsmen stare at an empty drawing board, gormless sailors think they help by tidying up the crime scene.

Night has fallen, and your ship is already in the tranquil bay when the look out screams "behind us!". There, looming in the darkness, gleams a dragon of iron, its nostrils livid with fire. "It's the vessel that killed Mr. Goode! But this one must be twice as large! We are at their mercy!" However, the bay is hidden from the bright gaze of the moon, and it is possible the dragon has not yet spotted you. If you choose to show yourself, you cannot expect to be a match for the dragon - only to somehow hinder it long enough to flee.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802854</GUID><Text>Fight your way out</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802855</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your aim is true, but the dragon is gathering its hot breath.&lt;/b&gt; To engage the hulking vessel is a humbling experience — the size, the power, the feet-thick armoured hull that your ordnance seems to only bounce limply off. The crew seem defeated, until they realise their precise fire at the dragon's stern, while showing no external sign of damage, appears to have caused a problem in the engine room. As a response, masked figures rush to prime the beastly mouth — a great cannon of fire! You must act quickly.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802856</GUID><Text>Maintain your fire on the weakened engine</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802857</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew cheer the cannoneers,&lt;/b&gt; and one good hit to the same spot does the trick!

As your crew escape, they are forced to pass close by the enemy, and see the gnarled and hateful iron of the bows and boards, the army of mocking masks, and the firepit of a mouth that could easily have been their end. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians always seem to be one step ahead, and are possessed of such fearful machinery. You set up camp in a secluded inlet further up the coast, confident it will keep you well-hidden.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802858</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your aim isn't quite as good this time.&lt;/b&gt; Your shots roll over the solid iron deck like balls of ivory on a bagatelle board, barely making a dent.

The two hulls are close enough for boarding, but there are just too many of the rogues.

To ensure their sacrifice is not in vain, your quick-thinking steersman takes advantage of the chaos and forces your ship past the enemy — just in time to see the army of mocking masks running your men through — and out of the bay to safety.

Having travelled for many days along the New World coast, &lt;b&gt;it is now time to decide how you will travel on from here.&lt;/b&gt; Ahead, a broad brown rivermouth invites you upstream, its perils waiting unseen beyond its bends. "Perhaps a route over land will be more forgiving?", says the navigator hopefully. One look at the dark and foreboding line of trees would suggest nothing could be further from the truth. "But which is the lesser of two evils, Admiral?"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802946</GUID><Text>Take the ship upriver</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802947</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Pyrphorian dragon is back on your tail!&lt;/b&gt; It seems hard to believe at first, but the distant chugging of an engine, and the black smudge of smoke above the ragged line of claw-foot mangroves are unmistakable. Your men, who had settled long enough to admire a proliferation of yellow flowers on the southern bank, suddenly find themselves at the mercy of twin horrors! Beyond the next bend are a set of &lt;b&gt;devious rapids&lt;/b&gt; frothing down towards you, and with the Pyrphorian dragon fast approaching, time is in short supply. There is a very narrow breach at one side, through which a vessel capably navigated may just about fit.

The line of approach is good too, squeezing your ship between the two craggiest protuberances of rock, as your vessel rides up several tiers of the rapids with little more than a bump. Though a steamer might be better suited to the task, the iron dragon makes no attempt to pursue. Your captain is quick to praise the great skill of your navigator, rather than face the troubling possibility that the Pyrphorians know of a greater danger to come. &lt;b&gt;The river has taken you as far as it can,&lt;/b&gt; and you must decide whether to continue across a marsh of uncertain depth, or as Ramón suggests, to head through a nearby network of caves.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802950</GUID><Text>Cautiously enter the marshes</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802951</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your men know those aren't logs bobbing in the marsh,&lt;/b&gt; and decide to wade well clear of the lurking black caiman, who from their chubby bellies appear to have had success in these waters. After a few cheerful hours of tramping, you reach a seemingly unremarkable clearing above the S marked on your map. "But what's this?". A young sailor reveals a mossy bunker in the forest carpet, "Long since deserted," he laughs, "your information must be out of date, Ramón." "Many years out of date," calls a voice from the trees. There is a rustle of foliage, as rifles poke through all around. "You!" a cowled man appears and points in your direction, "come with us."

Once your groaning survivors have been gauzed-up, you might still find them there.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801691</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Hmmn..." your navigator mumbles awkwardly&lt;/b&gt;, realising he has proposed almost every one of the myriad small harbours in the region. Someone coughs. Perhaps all these officers have been summoned to the cabin merely to share in his humiliation? "We've lost them then...", a skeptic pipes up, addressing the elephant in the room. "So what now?! Search every harbour?! Solicit a friendly local power for help?!!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801692</GUID><Text>Check every nearby harbour in the hope of finding them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801693</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The clouds finally part over Montoya.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew had been about to give up, until by chance, one of them caught sight of a ship. Moored in a secluded corner of the bay, it is the empty, but unmistakable property of the shadowy Pyrphorians you pursued. The contract must still be somewhere here in Montoya.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801694</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Needles and haystacks.&lt;/b&gt; You exhaust all feasible harbours. Not only is there no sign of your quarry, there is no method of knowing whether they have been and gone from a place, or if they were never there at all. The sea seems godless, wide and deep, and the crew long for it to swallow them up. Instead, however, they must return to Miss Hannah Goode, to explain their failure.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801695</GUID><Text>Appeal to nearby local authorities for information</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801696</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You're made to wait in line.&lt;/b&gt; Your diplomats may have done well to remember this local crest as one loyal to the crown, but you are not the only envoys present. Daiquiris, bananas and soft furnishings are small compensation for the time lost. Despite these formalities, the prefect transpires to be loyal. He intimates that Montoya is the only nearby place he has knowledge of that the Pyrphorians have their claws into. You cross your fingers, and head there yourself.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801697</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"They must have been in league with the Pyrphorians!"&lt;/b&gt; wails your duped diplomat. Having failed to detect local complicity— rooted either in fear or allegiance — your diplomat insists you sail south along the coast. Your expedition continues diligently for three days in that direction without sighting a single human settlement. "Since you're so fine with words," says the lieutenant to the diplomat in question, "perhaps you should explain our failure to Miss. Hannah Goode!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801698</GUID><Text>Trust your lookouts to keep you in range</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801699</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The lookout never loses them&lt;/b&gt;, despite the vessel being nearly out of sight. As its small grey outline rounds an island, the lookout gestures excitedly to starboard. He's seen the golden thread of an inlet which would let you cut the nose off the cape, and intercept the Pyrphorians on the other side.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801700</GUID><Text>Take a shortcut via the inlet</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801701</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You emerge right on top of them!&lt;/b&gt; Swinging masterfully through the stone jaws that gate the inlet, your navigators traverse a fantasy lagoon. Bursting beyond it into the bay, the ambush is received with complete surprise. With the freedom of the Pyrphorian ship, your crew find an ingenious-looking machine, but no sign of the Prosperity contract. As it's no longer on board, you're certain it must have changed hands in nearby Montoya, and make a beeline for the port.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801702</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's clear now why the Pyrphorians did not use the inlet themselves.&lt;/b&gt; Perhaps they were more willing to admit they didn't have the skill to navigate it without risking their ship. The inlet chokes, and a tooth-like incisor of rock rakes the boards from your hull. Limping out on the other side, you've made up the distance enough to see the Pyrphorians are headed to the port of Montoya. Your crew are very glad, since your ship is now in dire need of repair.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801703</GUID><Text>Maintain course, following them around the island</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801704</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Pyrphorians realise they must make port or be caught.&lt;/b&gt; As you round the cape, you see they're headed for the nearby settlement of Montoya. "Though we may not have caught them by sea," says your navigator, "they may have given away much more by leading us here; the only such haven for miles around."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801705</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The lookout loses them.&lt;/b&gt; Complacency sets in, when at first you appear to be catching them, but upon rounding a cape, you find they have vanished! Bright white settlements cluster the sound like a fairy circle, and it seems they could have docked in any one of them. "We've lost them!" a skeptic pipes up, "so what now?! Stick a pin in the map?! Solicit a friendly local power for help?!!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801706</GUID><Text>Study the map to guess their most likely docking point</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801707</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The navigator is as sure of himself&lt;/b&gt; as he can be in these circumstances. "If I were Pyrphorian, God help me, I would head for Montoya." his finger circles the large settlement, "It has a large marina where my devilish vessel might be easily concealed." Upon searching Montoya harbour, they indeed find the Pyrphorian ship in a secluded corner of mangrove. That being all well and good, they must hope now they've not lost too much time.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801708</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The navigator is as much as a failure as the lookout.&lt;/b&gt; Your ship makes a cat's cradle of the sound, as the navigator drags you hopelessly from one port to the next, almost at random. "Since you're so fine with directions," says the lieutenant to the diplomat in question, "perhaps you should explain where we went off course to Miss. Hannah Goode!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801709</GUID><Text>Appeal to nearby local authorities for information</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801710</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You're made to wait in line.&lt;/b&gt; Your diplomats may have done well to remember this local crest as one loyal to the crown, but you are not the only envoys present.

Yet, tranquil it is not. Anxiety is written on every passing face. They must surely know who you are and what you seek, but finding one brave enough to help is a different matter. You can ask around, or instead rely on your own eyes to find clues.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801715</GUID><Text>Ask the local Montoyans if they know anything</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801716</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your attaché hits it off with the harbourmaster&lt;/b&gt;, presenting you (not entirely falsely) as a fellow port official sympathetic to the Pyrphorian problem in the region. "I am sick of it," says the Montoyan, "whenever they come here, it's a nightmare for us! If you're willing to take action, it will be my pleasure to assist." Out on the sun-baked rooftop, he points upriver. "There, at the casona." A large verdant ranch wavers in the distance, the sanctuary of the Pyrphorians.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801717</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The only one who may be willing to help you is a Great Plainsman.&lt;/b&gt; The softly-spoken giant is hauling thick rope at the dock. "I would be putting my life at risk," he says gravely, looking over his shoulder. He seems to know something.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801750</GUID><Text>A little recompense always calms the nerves</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801718</GUID><Text>The Great Plainsman looks nervously over your goods</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801998</GUID><Text>Bribe</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801721</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"That should be enough to get me out of here,"&lt;/b&gt; he says, inspecting the merchandise. "They've taken the big ranch - they're using it for their gatherings. You'd better be ready if you're hoping to break in, though. See all these people? There's a reason they're afraid." You head for the ranch on the outskirts of Montoya, where darkness awaits.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801751</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801722</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"No!" he says&lt;/b&gt;, unwilling to risk his life for such scant reward. He glances around, sweeping back his long dark hair. It seems increasingly unlikely he will co-operate.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801719</GUID><Text>Threaten it out of him</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801723</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;He raises his hands, impressed, while remaining wary.&lt;/b&gt; "Perhaps you'll be the ones to finally unseat them." he says, pointing upriver, "They've taken the big ranch. They're using it for their gatherings. When you go there, expect trouble." He looks your soldiers up and down again, "Even if you do seem well prepared."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801724</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Seen enough of that in my lifetime,"&lt;/b&gt; he says with quiet defiance. Your soldiers hang their heads— with the Pyrphorians here, Montoyans hardly need you stirring up more trouble. "If all you have to offer is violence, take it to those who deserve it," he says, gesturing at a decrepit-looking warehouse towards the end of the quay. Then he disappears, without so much as a farewell.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801720</GUID><Text>Reassure him</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801725</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Your envoy is right," he says&lt;/b&gt;, "I can cover my tracks well enough." He nods upriver. "They've taken the big ranch - they're using it for their gatherings. You'd better be ready if you're hoping to break in, though. See all these people? There's a reason they're afraid." You head for the ranch on the outskirts of Montoya, where darkness awaits.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801726</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;He sighs deeply and rolls his eyes.&lt;/b&gt; "If you can't convince me, good luck convincing them to stop what they've begun," he says, gesturing at a decrepit-looking warehouse at the end of the quay. Then he disappears, without so much as a farewell.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801727</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your attaché's weepy plea&lt;/b&gt; is better received than anyone who had to hear it could have expected. "Of course we will help you stand against this terrible evil!" A local man says cheerfully, leading you to the end of the pier, where &lt;b&gt;a rather decrepit warehouse stands&lt;/b&gt;. "This is it. We're all counting on you!" he whispers encouragingly at the door, before hurrying away.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801728</GUID><Text>Smash down the warehouse door and charge in</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801729</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Of course, the Pyrphorians are ready and waiting.&lt;/b&gt; The warehouse appears to be a workshop for the production of devotional sculptures, its tables now flipped into barricades. Bullets ting through the many hundred stone representations of the goddess Pyr, as bodies drop on both sides. Eventually, the cultists prove too few. Having honored the dead, you conduct a search. There is no contract, but a fiery oculus stares up from the floor - it is a Pyrphorian paper tract, an invitation to a rally at the Casado estate.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801730</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your feeble bunch finally edge open the heavy door&lt;/b&gt;, only to find the building deserted. That it is owned by the Pyrphorians is clear. Carmine drapes smother the windows, and your people find themselves picking over the cult's instruments, whose purpose is unsettlingly opaque. "What's this oily liquid on the floor," someone says, just as the door slams shut, followed by the hasty rattle of padlock and keys. The Pyrphorian fire will burn bright and long at the quayside this night. Only one of your crew returns home.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801731</GUID><Text>Find some way to sneak inside</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801732</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew stalk noiselessly around the back.&lt;/b&gt; Scaling the wall, they find an open window obscured by a heavy carmine drape. Peering beyond it, they see a workshop for the production of devotional sculptures, its tables now flipped into barricades. With the cultists' attentions fixed on the main door, you're able to ambush them before it turns into a gunfight - but that doesn't stop two of your own being shot dead. Having honored the dead, your survivors conduct a search. There is no contract, but a fiery oculus stares up from the floor - it is a Pyrphorian paper tract, an invitation to a rally at the Casado estate.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801733</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They thought they'd been as quiet as church mice&lt;/b&gt;, but rounding the corner at the back of the warehouse, your crew has a nasty shock. Up on the balcony above, where you might have thought to gain entry to the warehouse, stands a single Pyrphorian clad in heavy garb; in his hands, a long brass pipe, from which erupts a searing cone of fire. Your people spread and dive for the sea, and the Pyrphorians torch your ship. Only one of your crew returns home.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801734</GUID><Text>Fan through the city, looking for clues</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801735</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your scouts pick up the scent immediately.&lt;/b&gt; "We recognised them as the fugitives from the boat we pursued, and followed them through Montoya to its outskirts. Up in the valley, there's a sizeable house on a large estate. They must have taken the contract there." You set off at once.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801736</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It seems the Pyrphorians have split.&lt;/b&gt; One you trace as far as the church, the other to a house of ill-repute— alternate refuges of the typical criminal. In neither case are the Pyrphorians still in evidence - you'll have to ask one of the respective proprietors instead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801737</GUID><Text>Go to the church and ask the Priest for help</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801738</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;None better than the priest&lt;/b&gt;, hidden in shadow, witness to every confession, to guide you. "Yes, the rogues were here, but they are gone now. I am powerless to stop them, just like everybody else." He tells of a darkness that grips at the Montoyan community, their suffering pouring through his doors— a last refuge for the holy. "Many speak of a ranch a little way up the valley, and a beacon, some infernal eye, that holds their wicked congregation rapt," he says. You realise that if the contract is anywhere, it's probably there.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801739</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew must trust the man of God.&lt;/b&gt; After all, he seems devoted to helping you cleanse Montoya of its heresy. "No, I have not seen them," he begins, "but many of my flock have confessed their fears as of late — their lost faith." He smiles blithely, and leads you from the church to &lt;b&gt;a decrepit warehouse on the dock&lt;/b&gt;. "If you too wish to rid yourself of your demons, I encourage you to begin here. Now forgive me, for I cannot abide violence," he says, taking his leave. You can try to break the warehouse door, or you can sneak in around the back.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801740</GUID><Text>Go to the den of ill-repute and ask the Madam for help</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801741</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Madam is only too happy to help following such charming propitiations.&lt;/b&gt; "Yes, the devils were here. They always are." She leads you through a lanterned garden of red dahlia, and points you up the valley to a ranch. "The sort of eye you seek is up there, at the casona," she clutches her wrist suddenly, "searing, burning — the Oculus." Lifting her hand, she reveals a grotesque brand on her skin. Mildly troubled, you set out for the ranch.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801742</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Madam refuses to help without payment.&lt;/b&gt; Time is money, and your mumbling mummers are wasting it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801743</GUID><Text>Spend some time in the establishment</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801744</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;All are commendably well-behaved.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors make surprisingly good companions, all paying what they owe. "Now that I have some evidence as to your good character," says the Madam, "I will help you." She leads you through a lanterned garden of red dahlia, and points you up the valley to a ranch. "The sort of eye you seek is up there, at the casona," she clutches her wrist suddenly, "searing, burning — the Oculus." Lifting her hand, she reveals a grotesque brand on her skin. Thanking her for her hospitality, you set out for the ranch.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801745</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;After an hour, your sailors are all over the place&lt;/b&gt;, singing and carousing, with one refusing to pay for services rendered. "Get them out!" screams the Madam. "But what of the information you promised?", "Out!". You have created enough of a scene. Fortunately, two boys waiting outside cheerily agree to help you for a bit of coin. They lead your band &lt;b&gt;to a warehouse&lt;/b&gt; from which they claim eerie sounds emanate at night - in their words, like "stakes being driven through the hearts of vampyrs." The door to the warehouse looks breakable.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801746</GUID><Text>Threaten her</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801747</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Alright, alright," she says bitterly&lt;/b&gt;, "Yes, the devils were here. They always are." She leads you through a lanterned garden of red dahlia, and points you up the valley to a ranch. "The sort of eye you seek is up there, at the casona," she clutches her wrist suddenly, "searing, burning - the Oculus." Lifting her hand, she reveals a brand on her skin. Feeling vaguely guilty for adding to the poor woman's woes, you set out for the ranch.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801748</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;She becomes strangely compliant&lt;/b&gt;, as if she is used to empty aggression. "This way," she says with forced sensuality. She takes you back over your own steps to the dock, and gestures a silked sleeve (from which no hand protrudes) &lt;b&gt;to a decrepit-looking warehouse&lt;/b&gt;. "There. I must leave you now." The warehouse door looks breakable.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801749</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There is no sign of the Pyrphorians&lt;/b&gt;, at least not that any of your twits see. Giving up their search, they begin stopping locals in the street. Most shake them off and walk on in a hurry, but they finally seem to strike lucky when two boys cheerily agree to help for a bit of coin. They lead your band &lt;b&gt;to a warehouse&lt;/b&gt; from which they claim eerie sounds emanate at night- in their words, like "stakes being driven through the hearts of vampyrs."

There is even an adjoining orangery, extending naturally towards the neat parterres of the sweet-smelling garden. An arc of white gravel serves as a drive, with long lines of equally white picket fence bordering the acreage in a typically colonial style. Indeed, were it not for the unusual height of this perimeter, and the shelters abutting it at regular intervals — armed guards no doubt stationed in each — it would appear much as any other estate. You consider your plan of entry.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801754</GUID><Text>Play it bold, launching an assault on the house</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801755</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The guards at the main gate are efficiently dispatched&lt;/b&gt;, and their keys are taken.

"We lost them", apologises the captain. But a few days later, Isabel receives a letter from one of her scouting parties, "Pyrphorian vessel spotted entering Montoya harbour." With renewed hope, the crew prepare to leave at once. &lt;b&gt;The contract, and those Pyrphorians must be here in Montoya, but where?&lt;/b&gt; The city sprawls before you under a pastel blue sky, the distinctive white walls and terracotta of Imperial La Corona glowing softly along the narrow estuary where the Mixcoatl meets the ocean. Yet, tranquil it is not. Anxiety is written in every passing face. They must surely know who you are and what you seek, but finding one brave enough to help is a different matter. You can ask around, or instead rely on your own eyes to find clues.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801942</GUID><Text>The Infiltration</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801943</GUID><Text>The sole survivor succeeds in getting back to Isabel's island. In his panic, he explains that the rest didn't make it, and describes how he traced the enemy back to an estate outside Montoya. The crew are assembled at once. They arrive to find the Casona looks quite modern, with white walls and pleasant gables. &lt;b&gt;The Prosperity contract must be here.&lt;/b&gt; An adjoining orangery extends naturally towards the neat parterres of a sweet-smelling garden. An arc of white gravel serves as a drive, with long lines of equally white picket fence bordering the acreage in typical colonial style. Indeed, were it not for the unusual height of this perimeter, and the shelters abutting it at regular intervals — armed guards no doubt stationed in each — it would appear much as any other estate. You consider your plan of entry.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801899</GUID><Text>You finally have your hands on the Prosperity contract!

Calculating you are no more than two days behind the Queen's retinue, you're able to draw a circle on a map that encompasses only a handful of suitably regal stopovers. &lt;b&gt;It is now but a question of exactly which of her landed relatives she came here to visit...&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803441</GUID><Text>Use your knowledge of the royal family to make a guess</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803443</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your familiarity with the Teutonic dynasties stands you in good stead.&lt;/b&gt; Whispers at home are growing ever louder on the subject of the Queen's suitors, and her cousin Ernest seems to be one of the front-runners. You visit the outspoken prince consort at his ivy-clad burg, and having presented a letter Sir Archibald gave you, he nods and leads you through its low, rib-vaulted ceilings, past gilt-candelabras and canvas portraits. &lt;b&gt;Though cordial, Prince Ernest seems a little twitchy.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803466</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You realise you've made the wrong choice from the moment you walk into the parlour.&lt;/b&gt; The Duchess, who is of middle-age, lies half-asleep in a four-posted bed, which from her dishevelled appearance it seems she has not left in days. "Excuse my zurprise," she croaks, "But a Queen, come here? When our zide of the family has been neglected for years?" She feigns a tortured expression. "But now we have darling visitors!" Anxious not to offend, you remain in her company until she eventually tires of her games. She lets slip the Queen is visiting her cousin, Prince Ernest. &lt;b&gt;Following a lengthy trip, the Prince offers you a cordial welcome at his ivy-clad castle, but appears twitchy throughout.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803444</GUID><Text>Try to read his thoughts through his twitches</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803459</GUID><Text>"From your movements, I sense that you too are worried for her welfare." &lt;b&gt;The subtlety of your deduction surprises Prince Ernest.&lt;/b&gt; He nods silently, and falls heavily into the ornate chair behind his desk. "She asked me to help trace our shared lineage — to establish the validity of certain claims she thinks she has through her ancestral ties to La Corona." Ernest pauses and crunches nervously on some recently-acquired shortbread. "She had wanted to do it alone for once. But she's taking a great risk, and I have now decided you must go after her. &lt;b&gt;There is to be a masked ball in Monégasque. You will find her there.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803460</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your strange deduction offends Prince Ernest.&lt;/b&gt; "From your movements, I sense this is a matter of the heart," is what you'd said, only for Prince Ernest to turn his back on you gothically, shouting — "How dare you! Prying into her personal affairs, as they all did during the crushing confines of her youth!" — before storming into the gardens to sulk. The next day, the Prince seems only very slightly calmer. "She asked me to help trace our family tree. That is all. I will not stop you going after her, in spite of your impertinence — but only because I am concerned for her welfare. &lt;b&gt;There is to be a masked ball in Monégasque. You will find her there."&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803445</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You can't imagine where she would have stayed in this town,&lt;/b&gt; pretty as it may be. You leave and take the road south, stopping beside an orchard to rest. Your knowledge of the local dialect is passable enough to overhear a couple of fruit-pickers talking about a recent distinguished visitor. &lt;b&gt;Curious, you ask them if they are referring to your Queen, at which they fall silent.&lt;/b&gt; It seems they've been sworn to secrecy.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803446</GUID><Text>Gently encourage them to give up all they know</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803447</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your authoritative presence unsettles them into confessing what they know,&lt;/b&gt; which frankly, being fruit-pickers, isn't that much more than you. One thing they have heard is that the Queen will be staying in luxury with family — a country residence, or castle with pointy tourelles, no doubt. &lt;b&gt;It is now but a question of exactly which of her landed relatives she came here to visit...&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803448</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The fruit-pickers don't believe you are who you threaten to be,&lt;/b&gt; and if anything, your surly attitude makes them wonder if you're the one the Queen has been running away from. They call out to the rest of the pickers, who stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them in case you should think of taking things any further. Turning miserably back to your carriage in the road, it's only after considerable soul-searching that you re-read Sir Archibald's briefing, "despite her secrecy, a Queen never travels humbly." Of course — how stupid! The Queen must be in one of the countless castles that dominate the hills all around. &lt;b&gt;It's now but a question of exactly which of her landed relatives she came here to visit...&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803449</GUID><Text>Offer them a suitably regal incentive for the information</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803450</GUID><Text>If you want to bribe us, it had better be with all the wonders of the high life!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803451</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They accept your offer. "She stay with family — at ze castle!"&lt;/b&gt; You are astonished to learn that the Queen dragged her skirts through the mud of the orchard, insisting that all her finely-dressed footmen should be fed and watered, and that no-one should know that she or her retinue were there. One of the pickers you bribed laughs, emulating her speech, "I hope you don't zink me too bohemian a Monarch." His friend reminds him with a sharp nudge that mocking the Queen might not be the best idea. &lt;b&gt;It is now just a question of exactly which of her landed relatives she came here to visit...&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803452</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They refuse.&lt;/b&gt; Clearly the fear of divine retribution against those who defy royalty is too strong. They call out to the rest of the pickers, who stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them in case you should want to take things any further. You turn miserably back to the carriage in the road, and it is only after hours of hopeful meandering in this beautiful country that you recall Sir Archibald's briefing: "Despite her secrecy, a Queen never travels humbly." Of course — how stupid! The Queen must be in one of the countless castles that dominate the hills all around. &lt;b&gt;It's now just a question of exactly which of her landed relatives she came here to visit...&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803453</GUID><Text>Ask a respectable-looking local if they've seen a fugitive Queen...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803454</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They don't take much convincing to tell you what they know,&lt;/b&gt; especially when you seem so sympathetic to the challenges of peasant life. "Passing foreign queens expect your silence for nothing, and yet it is you who must die in the fields for your masters when the harvest has failed." They grumble in recognition, noting that the Queen considered the town to be beneath her, and went off to stay in a nearby castle. &lt;b&gt;It's now just a question of exactly which of her landed relatives she came here to visit...&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803455</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The locals are stubborn in their silence.&lt;/b&gt; The Queen is a relative of those who own the land they work, and they fear for their livelihoods. However, there are further confirmations that the Queen has passed through, which leads you to the unlikely environs of a cider orchard. Two likely-looking pickers stand at the gate, both unable to disguise that they have recently met royalty — or that they have promised to say nothing about it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803456</GUID><Text>Use deduction to discern which royal the Queen is visiting</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803457</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You sneak upon proof it is her cousin Ernest she is visiting.&lt;/b&gt; While the Prince's welcome is polite, his stiffness of manner alerts your suspicions. When, after tea, he gives you the freedom of the ivy-clad castle, you waste no time seeking signs she was there. You find paper on the desk in a guest bedroom impressed with quill-marks, and make a rubbing. A letter from the Queen to her handmaid! It largely concerns itself with Ernest's handsome looks.&lt;b&gt;When you raise the subject with Prince Ernest, he becomes rather twitchy.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803458</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You are led a merry dance.&lt;/b&gt; It transpires the Queen has made several visits to family in the region, staying very briefly at each estate before being driven on to the next with her modest retinue. You try to puzzle the ultimate purpose of this, but can deduce nothing, and are instead left to visit each house in a process of elimination before you arrive exhausted at the ivy-clad castle of Consort Prince Ernest. &lt;b&gt;His nervous disposition suggests he knows the Queen's intentions in visiting.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803461</GUID><Text>Tell him that your only wish is to help the Queen</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803462</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Very well", agrees the Prince,&lt;/b&gt; once your persuasive speech has come to an end, "My dear cousin asked me to help trace our shared lineage — and to establish the validity of certain claims she believes she has through ancestral ties to La Corona." He removes a map of the continent from his neatly-arranged bureau. "Your diplomatic immunity may prove important in the days ahead. What she plans may put her at risk." He sighs. &lt;b&gt;"There is to be a masked ball in Monégasque. You will find her there."&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803463</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You have lost some face in royal circles.&lt;/b&gt; "I shall tell you nothing, nothing!" Prince Ernest says curtly, exhausted by your chatter, "Yet another interloper prying into her personal affairs, as so many did during the crushing confines of her youth!" The Queen's cousin then storms into the gardens to sulk. The next day, he seems only very slightly calmer. "She asked me to help trace our family tree. That is all. I will not stop you going after her, in spite of your impertinence — but only because I am concerned for her welfare. &lt;b&gt;There is to be a masked ball in Monégasque.

The theme is animal masquerade, and you see disturbing furred and feathered costumes at every turn.

Your eyes meet, and hers widen. She drops her glass, and there are gasps as she rushes for the exit. By the time you've forced your way outside, &lt;b&gt;her carriage has set off at speed.

"And finally, I notice we have a special guest." he smiles, at which a sequined elephant promptly rushes for the door, "Oh, your majesty, wait!!"

Undeterred by the howl and buffeting of the wind, they manage to put the sails 'in their gear' — loosing the sheetlines, and pulling the buntlines through, until the ship is safely running under jib alone. When the storm passes, the crew are delighted that &lt;b&gt;thanks to these mighty efforts, the ship has come through unscathed.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803898</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Not easy handling sails at minus thirty,&lt;/b&gt; and while those brave enough to take on the ice storm are strong enough, their labour is clumsy.

They can only watch as, under the pull of the sails, the mainmast cracks open like grissini, the upper section cartwheeling out to sea, a tangle of rigging behind it. The crew are all accounted for, but&lt;b&gt; the damage to the ship&lt;/b&gt; is probably irreparable.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803899</GUID><Text>Cut the ropes holding the sails</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803902</GUID><Text>Let the blizzard do its worst</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803903</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The mainmast takes much of the brunt,&lt;/b&gt; whipped and contorted in every direction by the impassioned sails.

It may hold with enough resin... but then again, maybe not..."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803905</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A bunch of wet lettuces.&lt;/b&gt; They claim that the rigging is too slippery to grip. If these are your best sailors, Lord help the others, but those sails must come down — the ship is being blown towards some jagged silhouette! You can &lt;b&gt;grab something to aid their climb&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;get them up there quick.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803906</GUID><Text>Risk finding a climbing aid</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803907</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;At least no-one dies.&lt;/b&gt; The crew raid stores for ropes and chains so as to climb the rigging safely, before stowing the sails away. The ship slows, but does not completely halt, colliding with that silhouette — a small and craggy island — and damaging the hull. &lt;b&gt;The crew have some lengthy repairs ahead of them.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803908</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A disaster of their own fashioning.&lt;/b&gt; Instead of finding a proper solution, the crew hurriedly don standard-issue gloves. The leather is so smooth in the palm, it is worse than climbing with no gloves at all. The ship lurches inexorably into that silhouette— a hideously craggy isle — and the impact flings the gripless riggers into the water. Visibility is so poor, and the water so cold, that &lt;b&gt;there's no hope of saving those who fell overboard.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803909</GUID><Text>Order the cowards up that mast, quick!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803910</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Filled with doubt, they do as instructed.&lt;/b&gt; The conditions are dreadful, and they can barely see to work in the sideways slather, what with the waves buffeting the ship. A man falls from the upper rigging, and is found to be only loosely intact. "What are you trying to prove?!" bellows the navigator above the whine of the wind. Finally, the sails are put up and the boat can ride out the remainder of the storm without blowing off course. &lt;b&gt;Your crew are incensed at the coldness of their superiors.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803912</GUID><Text>Stay inside and pray</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803913</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Faith and prudence.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors huddle below, rocked hard, but out of harm's way. They resist the temptation to attend to the creaking ship and its rudder, and instead trust their course to the divine. Soon the grog is flowing, with sailors playing cribbage, and all forget where they are. "Hold! I hear no storm!" a sailor says suddenly. The hatch is opened to reveal stillness and stars, and &lt;b&gt;a harlequin snake of an aurora, smiling down benevolent.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803914</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors will not wait for God.&lt;/b&gt; The storm shrieks its name, as sailors muttered frenzied supplications to the nameless. "To hell and damn you all, I want to die living!" the others bellow at them, and so unchained, they rush out into the white. Harsh commands can be heard above, before those voices fall silent. Somehow the ship rides out the storm, but &lt;b&gt;the bodies of your saviours are never found.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803915</GUID><Text>Save the propellers from the ice</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803917</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You have a hardy legion indeed.&lt;/b&gt; They rush to the tarpaulins, and with commendable teamwork and physical strength in the challenging conditions, are able to pull them over the ship's most sensitive instruments and machinery. Heading below deck to relax, &lt;b&gt;the heroes wait out the storm in luxury&lt;/b&gt; with buttered currant buns and hot tea.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803918</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Their defence of the ship is a little half-hearted.&lt;/b&gt; Initially the men show willing, but the blizzard quickly wears them down, and they retreat inside claiming that their work is done. After the worst of it has passed, the officers survey the ship. Beneath a poorly affixed and feeble tarpaulin, the engine is found flooded with slush that must now be cleared. &lt;b&gt;One has to wonder if they are cut out for these kinds of challenges.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>803919</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Tragic youthful over-exuberance.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors drain a bottle of strong rum before going back out, perhaps believing machismo will keep them warm. They batten the hatches in the white flurry, stumbling, belching and laughing. The hilarity continues when one of the lads slips and loses his feet — that is, until the steel rim of the funnel meets his head with a clomp. &lt;b&gt;He dies instantly.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804145</GUID><Text>Send an expert diver to unclog the propellers of ice</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804146</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The thrill-seeking diver relishes the task.&lt;/b&gt; Covering themselves in bear fat and brandishing a sharp pick, they enter the water without a splash, resurfacing no more than five minutes later to the embrace of a pre-warmed towel.

A girl, Tapeesa, is able to translate, and the others warm up when they hear the story of your journey over the ice flats.

The meek light of your vessel seems to dissolve into the moonless blackness. Even at easy sail and under constant vigil, your ship runs the risk here, for slumbering ice giants leer from the darkness in all directions. "Dead ahead!" comes the cry, but it's too late! A low growl shakes the boat, as a wave dumps it atop a iceberg — in the shape of an upturned molar — beaching it there. The ship is undamaged, if only it could be returned to the water...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804142</GUID><Text>Terrier Island (East)</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804001</GUID><Text>Break free with dynamite</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804002</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Nothing in nature can prevail against human endeavour,&lt;/b&gt; it would seem. The crew watch with trepidation as the fuses burn down to the stick, before an ear-splitting series of detonations rings across the vastness, sundering the icy claws that had held your ship hostage. A small blizzard of debris blankets the deck, to the delight of all aboard, for they are free once more!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804003</GUID><Text>Bombard the icy prison</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804004</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Ice crumbles around such firepower.&lt;/b&gt; Any cannon that can be swiveled at the target is put to use, chipping away at the icy dungeon in which the ship has become wedged, until the vessel breaks free. Like a cheerful sea lion, the fair vessel slips down an escarpment and plops back into the water. The crew cheer and continue on their way.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804005</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The iceberg fights back.&lt;/b&gt; Though the way is almost clear, the relentless cannonfire seems to have woken the ogre below, and to the horror of the crew the vast iceberg rolls slightly to one side. Great shards of ice detach and bounce over the deck, injuring your men. &lt;b&gt;Quick action is needed.&lt;/b&gt;</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804006</GUID><Text>Get out and push the ship free</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804007</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your men live for such challenges,&lt;/b&gt; and scarcely need telling what to do. Leaping down from the boat, they get behind her, knotting guy ropes as fast as they can. The iceberg still rumbles ominously, but it is your quick-thinking crew who prevail. Once clear of the ice field, the crew will be able to treat their wounds.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804008</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's an uphill struggle.&lt;/b&gt; The pitching of the unstable iceberg does not help one jot, as the men tumble and slide as they struggle to find their grip. Such is the effort required to pull the ship successfully down from the iceberg into the sea, no-one notices that one of the teams is missing. It appears they have fallen through a thin part of the ice to their deaths.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804009</GUID><Text>Let the rolling iceberg toss you into the sea.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804010</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your ship performs a rather messy dismount.&lt;/b&gt; After its initial roll, the iceberg halts long enough to suggest it wants to stay in its new position — but then everything happens all at once. The iceberg spins violently, and the ship with it! The ship strikes the water at such an angle that serious damage is done to much of the lee-side. Fortunately, the crew emerge unharmed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804011</GUID><Text>Build something to help you escape</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804012</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew assembles a dozen hardy levers to free the ship.&lt;/b&gt;  Flexible hickory planking is cut and reshaped into wedges, before being inserted into the ice at intervals of five paces, until they surround the stern. On a count of three the men lift — and to their surprise, so does the hull! Once it starts moving, there's no stopping it, and it clatters through all icy obstructions to the sea. Your sailors embrace — they have been very resourceful.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>804013</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The wrong wood is selected for the task.&lt;/b&gt; It is a decorative mahogany veneer, stripped from the Captain's cabin. "Whatever it takes," the Captain says with laudable magnanimity, but the whole business is futile. Despite the wedges being placed in great number at the stern of the ship, no amount of pressure from the crew can encourage the ship to move, since the levers lack the requisite spring.
