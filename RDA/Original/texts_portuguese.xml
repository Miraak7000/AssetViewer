So you really managed to do something right. It still doesn't prove much, though. You will need to do a lot more to earn the respect of people like myself. You can start by bringing me some more materials.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9778</GUID><Text>Surprised they reject you? A squit with not a gnat's cummerbund of reputability?

But some ex-trading partners of mine have been annoying me, so you are responsible for the safety of my ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9786</GUID><Text>Isabel Sarmento is a simpering wisp.

I have some unfinished business with them, so I will send a ship her way. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>9790</GUID><Text>Proud of your standing, ehh, but what does it mean?

Life is rejection, so reject life.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9797</GUID><Text>You have a sordid fetish for rejection.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9704</GUID><Text>All this talk about social status and what it means. Do you know what it really means? Absolutely nothing, all humans are useless creatures. I will let you experience how it means nothing first hand. I marked two ships of owners of different social status.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9705</GUID><Text>They turned you down, so what. You know, screw them, when I feel down, blowing things up makes me usually feel better. Why not get back at them while you are at it?

She thinks it's the best way to mingle with people and catch the latest rumors. Or even make up new ones.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>10027</GUID><Text>Beryl asks you to deliver concrete to her. She found out that some of her former supporters betrayed her and stomped on her "kindness" with their dirty feet.

She would like to combine both for a special delivery and asks the player for his help.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>10029</GUID><Text>Some people started to spread rumors about Beryl.

He plans to attack the ship and wants you to fight by his side.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16619</GUID><Text>I was schooled in the language of violence the hard way, some understand no other diplomacy than the tip of a cannon.

These criminals will be punished accordingly... Now take this filth away from my sight. Let Jean enjoy his time with them while he still can...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16713</GUID><Text>You crossed an ocean to save a person you didn't even know! Maybe you are someone I can call friend after all... You have my gratitude, and my people's.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16633</GUID><Text>Mon poteau, may I confide in you...? I still get bad dreams from the days I was a slave. I got sold to another landowner when I was but a child and never saw manman or papa again. I heard uncle Etienne escaped and lives a peaceful life in Puerto de la Rosa, he may know what happened to them...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16634</GUID><Text>Jean? Of course I remember the little rascal! I earnt my freedom years ago. His manman sadly passed away, but his papa was still under the same master when I left. They keep the records well guarded, but they will lead you to him if you can get them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16635</GUID><Text>These records... They are outdated, but there is a name: William Ward. I know it is a long shot, but my father might still be with him. I heard rumours of a slave ship near Puerto de la Rosa. If you can take a picture, I can see if it is our man or not.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16636</GUID><Text>It is him! They won't take my father away from me again, we strike now! Join me, my friend!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>16780</GUID><Text>My father... was not amongst them. The other slaves knew him, he passed not long ago... It's ok, friend, it was a peaceful death. We returned the ownership of their lives to these men and women. Most of us are former slaves, they will be welcomed in our independent nation. Thank you for bringing me peace, mon poteau, and for reminding me what we fight for.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9541</GUID><Text>"While Jean and I have a very different approach, we share a goal in which we face a common enemy.

Please make sure his efforts are not in vain.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>9547</GUID><Text>I am very much against it, but I am afraid not giving in to the current request to take action against an La Corona ship visiting us, will cause internal conflict or even a division.

pirates.&lt;/b&gt; Its captain is a friend to many of your crew, who are ready to die in order to save him. The pirates answer to Calico Roberts - the last terrible pirate - but the light is dim, and they have not noticed your ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800159</GUID><Text>Ask the advice of your former pirate</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800163</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'I knew this would come in handy someday,'&lt;/b&gt; the old cove mutters, as he unravels the flag of Calico Roberts. 'They wouldn't dare tear their master's cloth!' As your ship steers into view with the new flag, the pirates do nothing. They fully believe you serve the same master! Your guns fire and surrender is quick. The merchants are grateful and offer considerable compensation!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800160</GUID><Text>Fire cannons at the pirates' ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800164</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Success comes quickly.&lt;/b&gt; Volley after volley of ordnance so cleanly perforates the pirate hull, it is turned into alpine cheese. The surprised pirates are suddenly waving the white flag, and the skirmish is won. The merchants are thankful to see their goods returned and offer a fitting reward.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800166</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The attack is an abysmal failure.&lt;/b&gt; Almost every cannon shoots wayward, giving the pirates ample time to prepare their own onslaught. They laugh and cheer, and shout awful things as your tattered ship is forced to flee in shame.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800161</GUID><Text>Try to board the pirates' ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800165</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's a good fight in which the crew hold their nerve.&lt;/b&gt; At first range-finding proves difficult, alerting the pirates to ready their own guns. But after a few exchanges it is clear who is better-equipped, and the pirates raise the white flag. Although some of the men sustain injuries, the merchants are able to offer financial recompense.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800167</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The courageous crew triumph,&lt;/b&gt; rushing aboard quickly enough for it to be a surprise, before blowing half the pirates to dust with their blunderbusses. The remaining pirates drop their weapons, and the merchants are able to come out of hiding. 'A great reward is in order', they say, giving you a generous portion of the recovered loot.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800168</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Victory comes at a cost.&lt;/b&gt; Luck often plays a part in deck skirmishes, and your crew, unable to surprise the wary pirates, must take many casualties before asserting dominance. The merchants are indebted, and reward your rash heroism appropriately.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800169</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Boarding the ship is a grave mistake.&lt;/b&gt; The pirates are too quick and already have the initiative. The men are forced to retreat, kicking the boarding plank away. [AssetData([ExpeditionEventRequirement]) Text] and the others are condemned to a no-doubt gruesome fate.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800162</GUID><Text>Avoid the trouble spot entirely</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800170</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'We're bloomin' cowards!' cries a  furious sailor,&lt;/b&gt; as your ship whisks about, and sails briskly from danger. With the merchant ship left to the dogs, the crew fume at such a display of weakness at their friend's time of need.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801025</GUID><Text>Dockyard Dupe</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801026</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Robbed!&lt;/b&gt; Thanking the generous innkeeper, your ship is ready to leave. Everyone at the dock smiles and waves you off, and no wonder, valuable equipment is later discovered to be missing. You must decide now if it's worth going back for.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801027</GUID><Text>Have the detective investigate</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801032</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The detective already knows.&lt;/b&gt; 'I was waiting to see if our crew were complicit, but am satisfied they are not.' Your ship returns and lays a watertight case before the local authorities. With the guilty arrested your equipment is returned and your ship fully resupplied gratis.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801028</GUID><Text>Return and plunder the Harbour</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801033</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Swift justice.&lt;/b&gt; Petty defences crumble in the dawn light. Your ship yawns unopposed into the smouldering harbour, and turns its guns upon the harbourmaster's office. 'Please, take anything!' he yelps.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801034</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your assault is too slow.&lt;/b&gt; As you gain the upper hand over the harbour defences, the cavalry appear. Cannons pop from the west; local authorities come as reinforcement.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801035</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An absolute shambles.&lt;/b&gt; Couldn't even best a few locals and their primitive demi-cannon. 'What shall defeat us next?' yelp those who are not killed by the blast, 'A small, but angry gang of tortoises?'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801036</GUID><Text>Fight them all</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801037</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You put an end to corruption!&lt;/b&gt; Brought to their knees, the local authorities admit a conspiracy in which all are involved. 'It was never meant to go this far. We vow our people shall never rob again!' Proud to have effected change, you take back your possessions and leave.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801038</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The enemy force is vast.&lt;/b&gt; 'How many are there, captain!? We must turn back.' But it is too late. Soon it is not just the western cliff lit up with cannonfire, but your ship. Many lives will be lost before you crawl out of range.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801039</GUID><Text>Make peace, and reason with the officials.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801040</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They are wiling to listen.&lt;/b&gt; After an exasperating few days, you are finally able to prove your losses. The authorities take in the guilty dockers, and most, but not all of your possessions are returned.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801041</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The authorities stand with their own.&lt;/b&gt; You put your case as best you can, but it's not enough. Furthermore, you must answer for the damage you've caused. Unfortunately, this means leaving one of your best behind to help with repairs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801029</GUID><Text>Return disguised and bait the robbers</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801042</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You rumble the schemers!&lt;/b&gt; The crew set aside superstition, daubing your ship a new name. Cut-throat sailors pose as officers, with cabin curtains repurposed as sashes to mark them strangely. Taken in by it all, the innkeeper and his dockside associates are caught in the act. You make sure to relieve them of far more than they stole.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801043</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It works, at first.&lt;/b&gt; A lick of paint, and the ship differs enough to blend in at the busy port. Moustaches and clothes aren't enough for the crafty innkeeper though. 'Thought you could fool us?' he scoffs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801044</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;With feeble disguises&lt;/b&gt;, your party can't believe the inn doesn't out them. But then there's laughter, as patrons turn in unison, guns held to your heads. 'Better hope its not cold where you go!' the innkeeper says. Your crew are stripped, bound, and packed off to sea.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801045</GUID><Text>Take back what is yours by force</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801047</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes a fistfight is the only way.&lt;/b&gt; The inn is a hurricane of chair and glass, as your crew express themselves the only way they know how. Once the locals are subdued, the innkeeper is dragged outside, his life now security against whatever plunder you please.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801048</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The locals are brutal.&lt;/b&gt; Home-made knuckles, knives and cudgels scrape open the faces of your crew. Some are to bleed out on the sticky hostelry floor, the bloody remainder, to be packed off by the authorities for disturbance of the peace.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801046</GUID><Text>Threaten to expose their scheme</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801049</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The innkeeper relents.&lt;/b&gt; 'We've got a good thing going here, and I don't want you spoiling it,' he sniffs, 'take what's yours and leave.' The crew have back what they lost, but thoughts are spared for the scheme's next unwary victims.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801050</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Get out, before we scratch you out!'&lt;/b&gt; growls the innkeeper, true colours plain. It seems the whole port is on his side. The expedition must take the loss of time and equipment on the chin.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801030</GUID><Text>Ask the local authorities to take action</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801051</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You make the case well.&lt;/b&gt; 'You are quite right. Terrible corruption such as this must be put to an end!' says the governor, 'you shall have back what was taken.' His disingenuousness stinks to high heaven, but there's no time for deeper digging.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801052</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They are corrupt.&lt;/b&gt; 'What a fantastical story. I am so glad our country has fired your imagination!' smiles the governor.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801053</GUID><Text>Risk implicating the governor</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801055</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Clever. Very clever.'&lt;/b&gt; He lights a cigar. 'How did you know the innkeeper was my brother?' Your emissary sensibly avoids the truth that it was guesswork. 'Take whatever you want,' he says gesturing to a warehouse bursting with seized goods.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801056</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'That was your last mistake,'&lt;/b&gt; chuckles the governor, as his poplar-lined palace swarms with militia, 'arrest these fops!' Your delegation try to resist, but they are armed only with the toothpicks that came with their canapes. Your expedition must manage without them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801054</GUID><Text>Resort to violence</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801057</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Alright, alright!'&lt;/b&gt; says the amused governor, bayonet to his neck, 'take what you want. But then you leave.' Since the harbour is now well-guarded, you've done well to force a compromise.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801058</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'That was a mistake,'&lt;/b&gt; chuckles the governor, as his poplar-lined palace swarms with militia, 'arrest them!' Your crew would rather die than be locked-up for life, so they fight their way out. At least, one or two of them do.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801059</GUID><Text>Give up and leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801060</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Widespread frustration among the crew.&lt;/b&gt; 'The instruments were vital for my research!', 'You let those beggars off scot free?!', 'This expedition is an embarrassment!' Hard to argue with their assessment, and bad for morale.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801031</GUID><Text>Take the loss on the chin</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801061</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Widespread frustration among the crew.&lt;/b&gt; 'The instruments were vital for my research!', 'You let those beggars off scot free?!', 'This expedition is an embarrassment!' Hard to argue with their assessment, and bad for morale.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801620</GUID><Text>Wall of Ice</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801621</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ship has hit an iceberg!&lt;/b&gt; Navigating in the dark proved to be folly: what little lighting the ship provides for itself does not compensate for the absence of moonlight. A low thud shakes the entire boat, and the swinging lights of night lanterns reveal the rampart-like block of ice they have run into. A crevice splits the iceberg and the ship is stuck inside.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801622</GUID><Text>Destroy the iceberg with dynamite</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801626</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No obstacle can prevail before human might.&lt;/b&gt; Sticks of dynamite are tied to the iceberg's flanks and lit in a perfect synchrony, exploding in a tidy and devastatingly efficient manner. Impressed by their own skill, the crew happily resumes the trip.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801623</GUID><Text>Bombard the ice with all cannons</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801627</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The iceberg crumbles under the impressive firepower of the ship.&lt;/b&gt; The port and starboard cannons are fired, denting the ice inch by inch until it breaks into pieces which fall into the water with huge splashes. The ship's iron prow pushes against the formidable obstacle and breaks through under the cheers of the crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801628</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Those puny cannons cannot take down the wall of ice.&lt;/b&gt; Frozen shards rain on the deck with each new cannon blast, and they cut and slice into the sailors - tiny wounds which make it seem like the iceberg is fighting back. The crevice surrounding the ship has gotten bigger, but still refuses to let it go.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801629</GUID><Text>Climb the iceberg to plant explosives inside</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801631</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A risky reward for a risky attempt.&lt;/b&gt; Using what nails and planks they can hammer into the wall of ice, a group of sailors climbs it and manages to reach its top, where they plant a barrel of gunpowder. The explosion lights the night, pulverizes the wall, and nicks the ship's hull. The vessel can leave after light repairs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801632</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Climbing does not simply consist of walking upwards.&lt;/b&gt; The men slip, slide, shift and totter, and their best effort resides in climbing on each other's shoulders to try and reach new heights. They don't, and the human ladder crashes onto the deck, leaving all of its rungs bent or definitively broken. The remaining crew must wait for the ice to melt by itself before they can leave.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801630</GUID><Text>The iceberg is weakened, wait for it to melt</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801633</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Days melt into weeks which melt into months.&lt;/b&gt; With each passing moment, the ice grows a bit weaker, but constant observation makes it seem like nothing is changing. The wait drives the crew restless and their tension escalates into regular, if unjustified, brawls. When the ice finally lets them go, all sailors have gained their small share of madness.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801624</GUID><Text>Build a device to push the ice away</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801634</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew assembles a perfect lever to free the ship.&lt;/b&gt; Unbolting the decorative guardrail of the prow and roping it to the starboard railing, they manage to create a semblance of a pry bar which sneaks between the hull and the ice and pushes the latter away. The sailors row their way out to the cadence of a beloved song.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801635</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There is a difference between imagining and actually creating.&lt;/b&gt; The lever mechanism devised by the engineers is as unmanageable as it is ugly and the shape of the thing, which defies the very concept of aesthetics, is a testimony to its chaotic behaviour. The crew gives up any idea of building their own escape device.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801625</GUID><Text>Pray for help</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801636</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Patience and good faith reward the sailors' prayers.&lt;/b&gt; The following day is devoid of clouds or wind and the perfect weather attracts fishing boats to deeper seas. The stuck ship is seen and rescued right away. The navigators hasten to warn their fellow seamen of the danger and are even offered a space in the prestigious Practical Pilot navigation guide. Such an accident will never happen again!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801637</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Prayers take a long time to reach whoever is listening.&lt;/b&gt; The crew waits, digging into their supplies and entertaining themselves however they can. Rescue finally comes after one full week in the form of a whaler which drags the ship out from its ice prison, and the sailors, relieved but tired, can't help but wonder if they could have made it out on their own.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801638</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Nobody is answering these prayers.&lt;/b&gt; After days of idling in the cold and gnawing through their supplies and patience, the crew's discontent rises to the extent that they cannot bear to wait any longer. If help does come, it will come from themselves.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802094</GUID><Text>Sea Still</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802095</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Tangled!&lt;/b&gt; The Sargasso Sea was made famous by Columbus' sailors and their fear of entrapment: indeed, the vast surfaces of algae that stretch above the diamond waters look ominous, and their menace is confirmed by the ship standing still in their midst. Your own vessel avoids the brown plants, when a call rings from the stuck ship. There are still sailors onboard! You have no proper rescue equipment and risk getting tangled - should you try to help?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802096</GUID><Text>A steam ship fears no entanglement - go rescue them!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802099</GUID><Text>Your steam ship rides through the algae as if it was nothing. In fact, it is. The algae parts before your ship from the sole movement of the waves. Your sailors stay stunned as they see the legend break before them, and the rescued crew reveal their truth: it was the dreadfully calm winds of the Sargasso sea that caught their ship, not the flimsy algae. The saved sailors happily join your own and marvel at the steam ship's independence from the winds.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802097</GUID><Text>Help from a distance and fire a roped harpoon at their ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802100</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A perfect shot.&lt;/b&gt; With just the right dosage of propulsion strength and aiming power, the harpoon strikes the stranded ship's starboard without damaging too much of its hull. The rope is collected by the crew onboard and they bind it to their railings before waiting for your instructions.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802102</GUID><Text>Tie a buoy to the improvised zip line and create a transportation device</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802104</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A flawless breeches buoy.&lt;/b&gt; The buoy is tied with ropes and cloth to create a solid leg harness, allowing the stranded sailors to be pulled to your ship in an almost comfortable manner. Once freed of the algae embarked on their clothes, the rescued crew eagerly offer their services to repay their life debt.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802105</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The buoy comes undone with the first rescue attempt.&lt;/b&gt; As soon as a sailor climbs onto the contraption, it slips and swirls and sends him into the water. The ripples part the algae, revealing how meek the obstacle was: it was the still winds, not the plants, which prevented the ship from moving. The crews from both ships watch helplessly as the man drowns in the clear waters, before resuming their rescue in gloom and shame.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802103</GUID><Text>Encourage the sailors to climb the rope and cross the distance on their own</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802106</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A surge of courage animates the stranded sailors.&lt;/b&gt; Under the cheers of your crew and the repeated encouragements of your lieutenants, they grab the rope and, with the desperate strength of hope, they cross the distance to reach your ship. Their miraculous rescue leaves them stronger and confident in both their skills and your crew's good will - they join your sailors without a second thought.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802107</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Hope alone cannot give them strength.&lt;/b&gt; Encouraged by your crew, one of the sailors of the stuck ship takes hold of the rope and suspends himself, legs crossed and hands gripping the hemp. As he begins his travel the coarse fibbers nibble his skin and the blood rushes to his head. He grabs a new handful of rope, fails, slips, falls. If he manages to climb back onboard, no other volunteer wishes to attempt the crossing, and you have to leave without a single sailor rescued.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802101</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Harpooning a ship without sinking it requires skills you crew doesn't have.&lt;/b&gt; The harpoon crashes into the stranded vessel and breaks through its starboard, allowing water to gush inside. Panicked screams emerge from the ship as several sailors jump into the water's algae in a desperate attempt to save themselves.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802108</GUID><Text>Send strong sailors with buoys to rescue them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802110</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The rescue is cruelly easy.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors plunge into the waters and see the algae part before them: there's no real obstacle here. They grab the stranded crew as it drifts to them and bring them back onboard, where the rescued men explain that it was the dead winds which forced their ship to stay still. Their thankfulness is barely enough to erase your wasted efforts and the shame of your crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802111</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The rescue is a failure.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors push each other, trying to swim while pulling the huge buoys, and they paddle like young dogs discovering their first waters. They are exhausted way before they can reach the stranded ship, and they turn around despite your crew's encouragements and the lieutenants' orders. There is no ignoring the curses of the drowning sailors as your ship sails away.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802109</GUID><Text>You will not risk sharing their entangled fate: leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802112</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;We did what we could.&lt;/b&gt; Fully aware that your crew's attempt did nothing but worsen the stranded sailors' fate, your lieutenants attempt a speech to lighten their burden. The sailors pretend to cheer up, but the thought of the abandoned ship stays with them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802098</GUID><Text>Do not take any risk and leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802113</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Someone better equipped might come their way.&lt;/b&gt; Or we will call for help at the next harbour. Or this could be a trap. Or we didn't really hear a call. Excuses after excuses are discussed this night, and none sounds true enough for the sailors' hearts to be at peace.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802745</GUID><Text>Jolly Roger</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802746</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's a pirate ship!&lt;/b&gt;The crew thought them extinct, but reality proves them wrong: a torn black flag bearing skull and bones flaps against the weather-worn mast of the approaching ship. The spectral silhouettes of starved men pile up against its rail guards, eager to feed on their prey.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802747</GUID><Text>Release an anchor to pivot and face the attacking ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802749</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;These scoundrels will see what true sailors look like!&lt;/b&gt; In a demonstration of their tactical flair, your crew works to release the starboard anchor. The weighed cross dives into the sea, finds a sturdy ledge, and commands the ship's movement. Your vessel jumps and drifts to the side - face to face with the pirates.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802751</GUID><Text>Fire the cannons!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802753</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Flawless victory.&lt;/b&gt; The volley of cannonballs demolishes the pirate ship's flanks, each projectile aimed at the most mould-ridden parts of the wood. The antique vessel collapses on itself and your sailors have but to watch the pirates drown then loot the flotsam at will.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802754</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Was this aimed at the pirates or the actual sky?&lt;/b&gt; Your cannonballs fly way over the pirate ship and allow the scoundrels to react to your sudden manoeuvre. The tide of the battle shifts in their favour again as grappling hooks catch your ship and lock it into place.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802755</GUID><Text>Defend against the boarding pirates</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802757</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Today is not the day you are vanquished by pirates.&lt;/b&gt; The attackers barely set foot on deck that your sailors launch their assault, a coordinated charge grinded into perfection by years of practice. Still, the pirates resist to the best of their ability, and their desperate foray costs the lives of a few good men.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802758</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Panic.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors lose their nerve and cannot handle the very thought of being boarded - they abandon their posts and weapons and beg for a mercy that is not given. The pirates, at least as frantic as their victims, slaughter several crew members before noticing their surrender. They plunder your supplies and scurry away.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802756</GUID><Text>Surrender to them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802759</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A refusal to fight.&lt;/b&gt; Bound by their code of honour, the pirates spurn the idea of killing any of the surrendering sailors and help themselves to your supplies. The shabby scoundrels celebrate their meagre plunder with glee and leave your crew riddled with pity for their attackers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802752</GUID><Text>Bombard them with handmade grenades!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802760</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The pirates didn't expect such a crafty attack.&lt;/b&gt; Instead of using the cannons, your sailors prepare explosives akin to those used in trench wars: a bottle filled with powder, hemp for the fuse, nails for the visual. The grenades spit their fire into the enemies' ship and terrify the pirates, who have never seen such techniques before. The tattered attackers summon your crew's pity, who lets them leave in exchange of a symbolic fee.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802761</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Shouldn't your sailors focus on what they actually know?&lt;/b&gt; The crew improvises grenades based on hearsay of military tales, pouring powder and rusty metal into bags of moist hemp - unstable bombs which explode as soon as their fuse is lit. The sailors don't even have the time to count their victims: the pirates use the mayhem as a diversion, and they board your ship!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802750</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The manoeuvre is a mess.&lt;/b&gt; There is a wide difference between the intent and the result. What tactical advantage your crew thought they could gain over the pirates is lost as soon as the anchor enters the water, slowing the ship down and turning it into a perfect target for its attackers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802762</GUID><Text>Insist on fighting and steer the ship to face them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802764</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Nice rectification.&lt;/b&gt; Fighting against the pulling anchor and the pushing current, your helmsman manages to stir the ship to the side and makes it face the pirates' vessel. This sequence of surprising movements gives your crew a small window of action before the pirates can react.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802766</GUID><Text>Fire all cannons!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802768</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Send the pirates down to the depths!&lt;/b&gt; First their mainmast, then their sails, then the deck itself: the pirate ship is bombarded in a relentless yet precise manner. Soon the pirates' corpses litter the sea, and your crew is free to fish their well-deserved rewards from the carcass of the pirate ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802769</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew is not up to the challenge.&lt;/b&gt; The first volley of cannonballs glides over the pirate ship and, quite remarkably, manages to miss the ship, its sails, and its masts. The attackers retaliate with their own cannons and the sea becomes a stage for your explosive exchanges. When the smoke clears, both ships are ruined and the pirates scamper away. Your crew celebrates their victory while trying to ignore the extensive damage.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802767</GUID><Text>Prepare to board!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802770</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A present for Davy Jones, and booty for your crew.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors are fighters by nature, and the ramshackle pirate crew is no match for them. What few scoundrels oppose the assault are sent to greet the fishes and the others are forced to surrender - your crew plunders their ship but find little loot on the decrepit vessel. It is pity more than mercy that makes them spare the pirates.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802771</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's no denying your crew's lack of strength.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors throw themselves at the pirates with a noticeable will to fight but hardly enough skill to fulfil their dreams of domination. The scrawny pirates beat the crew and leave, slightly less bruised and weary than their victims but too drained and wounded to linger on your ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802765</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Too hasty.&lt;/b&gt; Your helmsman is used to conventional manoeuvres only, and steering the ship while its anchor is still grazing the sea floor is beyond his nautical comprehension. The entire ship shakes and swirls, drifting over the waves in a violent jump which sends it crashing into the pirate ship. The scoundrels board you!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802772</GUID><Text>Fight till the decimation of either crew</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802774</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An underwhelming victory.&lt;/b&gt; Yes, your crew manages to gain the upper hand over the pirates and displays decent self-control and fighting skill, but the pirates are far from their image of wondrous sea fighters. They are weak. The skeletal attackers scatter as your sailors crush them, and your broken deck is littered with scrawny corpses. The repairs take a lesser toll on morale than the gnawing pity your crew feels for the scoundrels.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802775</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors' desperation is no match for the pirates'.&lt;/b&gt; The attackers pour from the carcass of their ship, oblivious to the large faults in the wood, flowing like blood from a wound. They wash over your sailors, who scatter in their current, unable to oppose resistance and too weak to even consider it. When the wave of pirates recedes, your deck is covered in fragments of both ship and men.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802773</GUID><Text>Listen to reason and surrender</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802776</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;This should have been done much earlier.&lt;/b&gt; Your weapons are dropped just in time for the pirates to stop their assault. They spare the crew in exchange for a decent quantity of loot - however, their mercy will never give back the men lost to your hazardous manoeuvres and their outstanding failure.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802763</GUID><Text>That's enough risk-taking: surrender</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802777</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A refusal to fight.&lt;/b&gt; Bound by their code of honour, the pirates spurn the idea of killing any of the surrendering sailors and help themselves to your supplies. The shabby scoundrels celebrate their meagre plunder with glee and leave your crew riddled with pity for their attackers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802748</GUID><Text>Let them come, rouse the spirit of the crew with a speech</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802778</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There is faith in the upcoming victory.&lt;/b&gt; Your acting lieutenant climbs the rail guard and points his gun at the skies, defying the heavens themselves. I am weak, vulnerable, he says, like well-born men are - but while my body is feeble my heart is that of a captain, and your captain no less. And like you sailors I will fight, and I will fight to the death, and I will continue to fight after this death, for not a single pirate will lay a single finger on our ship, in this life or in the next!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802780</GUID><Text>Board the pirates' ship!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802782</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A fantastic charge.&lt;/b&gt; Led by the acting lieutenant, your sailors hurtle down the boarding bridges and storm the pirate ship, leaving a trail of mangled scoundrels in their wake. The black flag is torn from its mast and the pirate booty is plundered. Taken by a sudden generosity, your crew lets the survivors scurry away with their wreck of a vessel. They might be the last pirates alive.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802783</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors' strength is mental only.&lt;/b&gt; They lack both the skill and speed required for a quick take-down of the boarded ship, and allow the pirates to regroup behind makeshift barricades of crates and sacks of goods.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802784</GUID><Text>Take cover and shoot from a distance</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802786</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The pirate ship is a playground for your crew.&lt;/b&gt; They avoid the shots of the scoundrels with ease and take cover, burying behind overthrown barrels of rum and taking down the pirates, accurate shot by accurate shot. When not a single enemy is left standing, your ship recovers its crew and leaves - victorious, but drenched in the smell of alcohol and gunpowder.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802787</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew is ill-prepared for this challenge.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors run around in circles, unable to settle on a good cover while the pirates shoot at will, taking them down with ease. The remaining members of your crew are spared in exchange of their cargo, and your expedition takes a toll from this loss.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802785</GUID><Text>Continue your charge!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802788</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A manifestation of their true skill.&lt;/b&gt; Despite its initial fumbling, your crew manages to reach the pirates' covers and forces its way through the barricades, overpowering the scoundrels in a matter of minutes. Not a single pirate is left standing, and as few sailors as possible suffered the same fate. It was the best they could do.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802789</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Stubbornness will not trigger miracles.&lt;/b&gt; Still proving how unskilled and weak they are, your sailors crash upon the pirates' barricade like foam upon the shore, and the gunshots scatter them across the deck. The pirates meet no resistance when they raid your ship, and the survivors shamelessly thank their attackers for taking nothing more than cargo.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802781</GUID><Text>Fire all cannons!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802790</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Flawless victory.&lt;/b&gt; The volley of cannonballs demolishes the pirate ship's flanks, each projectile aimed at the most mould-ridden parts of the wood. The antique vessel collapses on itself and your sailors have but to watch the pirates drown then loot the flotsam at will.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802792</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Was this aimed at the pirates or the actual sky?&lt;/b&gt; Your cannonballs fly way over the pirate ship and allow the scoundrels to react to your bold, but uncontrolled manoeuvre. The tide of the battle shifts in their favour as grappling hooks catch your ship and lock it into place.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802793</GUID><Text>Defend against the boarding pirates</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802796</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Today is not the day you are vanquished by pirates.&lt;/b&gt; The attackers barely set foot on deck that your sailors launch their assault, a coordinated charge grinded into perfection by years of practice. Still, the pirates resist to the best of their ability, and their desperate foray costs the lives of a few good men.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802797</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Disaster.&lt;/b&gt; The courage of your sailors is not matched by their force, and the pirates wash through them like a wave through sand. When the attackers finally decide that culling your crew is not worth their time, the remaining sailors do not dare retaliate and simply stand their ground, keeping watch on their wrecked ship and devastated pride.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802794</GUID><Text>Surrender to them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802795</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A refusal to fight.&lt;/b&gt; Bound by their code of honour, the pirates spurn the idea of killing any of the surrendering sailors and help themselves to your supplies. The shabby scoundrels celebrate their meagre plunder with glee and leave your crew riddled with pity for their attackers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802779</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's no spirit nor courage to be roused.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew barely reacts to your lieutenant's speech, hypnotized by the approaching pirate ship, entranced by their terror. The attackers board the ship and everything is both too fast and too slow: the massacre of the resisting sailors, the looting, the pirates' departure. When the crew regains its senses, they realize the price of their cowardice.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800277</GUID><Text>The Ghost Ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800254</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;After weeks of hot weather, supplies of drinking water have become dangerously low.&lt;/b&gt; It therefore seems a minor miracle when a fellow ship appears on the horizon, for surely they have water to share? But as it draws near, the crew is aghast, for there is no sign of life aboard. 'It is a ghost ship, we must flee before it is too late!' they cry.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800255</GUID><Text>Send a diver to check it out</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800258</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The diver does remarkably&lt;/b&gt; to spot the fiends furled in sails, or waiting under barrels to ambush, should your men have boarded. Your ship draws alongside the vessel as if to pass, but then unleashes enough cannon-fire to drown it. The crew are elated, believing they have done the oceans a great service.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800256</GUID><Text>Heathen superstition! Board the ship!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800259</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Heavens shine upon you,&lt;/b&gt; for whatever caused the crew to vacate this ship seems no longer a concern. Better yet, the lord has seen fit to provide the water you seek.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800260</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ship's hold contains an unholy mound&lt;/b&gt; of corpses. 'God hath forsaken these men', says the doctor, 'but how?'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800262</GUID><Text>Have the doctor investigate what happened</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800264</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'We are lucky indeed,&lt;/b&gt; for malaria cannot reach us now.' says the doctor confidently. This swift diagnosis confirms the crew are pleased to load up the drinking water they have been gasping for.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800265</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Touch nothing! Get off the ship,'&lt;/b&gt; frets the doctor, who believes a dreadful plague has taken the crew of this ill-fated vessel. Perhaps drinking water is itself the cause. The crew are miserable time has been wasted, and that their thirst is still not slaked.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800266</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor is inconsolable,&lt;/b&gt; 'it is plague. I lanced a bubo, and it ruptured suddenly upon my person!' That the water be contaminated is misery enough, but to have to abandon the good doctor is a disaster! Your expedition drifts glumly on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800263</GUID><Text>Leave the ship immediately</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800267</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No relief at escaping the grotesque mound of corpses,&lt;/b&gt; can compensate the terrible thirst of your crew. There are murmurings that no such expedition can succeed if 'gift horses always be looked in the mouth.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800261</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew are so faithless,&lt;/b&gt; that every creaking plank aboard the ghostly ship raises a whimper. So when a banshee howl erupts from below deck, every sailor runs for their life. One poor soul trips in a coil of rigging and cracks their head upon an iron capstan. The death exposes all the more the crew's foolishness.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800257</GUID><Text>Leave and hope to find an island with drinking water soon</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800268</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No relief at escaping the disturbingly empty ship,&lt;/b&gt; can compensate the terrible thirst of your crew. There are murmurings that no such expedition can succeed if 'gift horses always be looked in the mouth.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800269</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Terrifyingly, the ship takes after yours in pursuit.&lt;/b&gt; Who knows what dread hands operate its multifarious controls!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800270</GUID><Text>Try to outrun the awful vessel!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800272</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your ship manages to escape&lt;/b&gt; the ghoulish clutches of that unwholesome adversary, but have no drinking water, or anything else, to show for the ordeal.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800273</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your ship is not agile enough.&lt;/b&gt; Men pour into the waves from where enemy cannons punch holes. Seemingly contented with this sacrifice, the dread sentience commanding the vessel calls off its dreadful pursuit.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800271</GUID><Text>Turn and face it, whatever it is!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800274</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Pirates! But trickery cannot match the power of a modern seaship!&lt;/b&gt; Summarily demolished, a few of them are left clinging to wreckage. They beg to join your cause - unpaid. Such are the dwindling prospects of piracy in this day! The crew will jibe at them, but secretly all must be elated to have acquired such sea-wisdom for free.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800275</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A pirate nuisance!&lt;/b&gt; Though their scurvy deception gives them advantage, they are like many of their creed, rather jaded. By the time their ship is sunk, it has cost you a few good men. Yet the recovery of precious drinking water in among the flotsam, assuages the grief of your crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800276</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Bloody pirates! A terrible menace even in this day and age!&lt;/b&gt; Your crew are outmanoeuvred, outsmarted, and your ship is reeled-in for boarding. Many are killed in valiant defence of the company, but to no avail. Your vessel is duly ransacked for supplies, before the villains are again on their way.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800537</GUID><Text>The Visitation</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800538</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An undesirable visitor haunts the ship.&lt;/b&gt; Fleeting silhouettes, knocking and screeching sounds. Each morning the ship appears in utter disarray. 'A night fiend,' gulps the hardiest of old crewmen, as he sweeps debris from the deck. As night draws in again, you realise something must be done.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800539</GUID><Text>Listen to your expert</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800543</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Every right to a little joke.&lt;/b&gt; 'These claw marks!' the naturalist feigns horror. 'Is it something terrible?!' asks a fearful sailor. But the naturalist can bite tongue no longer, and succumbs to laughter; 'No! Good heavens. We have a mother and kittens aboard!' The cat family is found in a barrel, which, it is agreed, shall serve as their home for the duration. The crew dote on the little rascals, their presence a great comfort.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800540</GUID><Text>Perform an exorcism</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800544</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Each sailor strides with inner conviction,&lt;/b&gt; as they form a procession of candles behind the smug-looking priest, flooding holy light into every heathen crevice. The priest's ritual is unfaltering, and not only are the crew rid of the night-time menace, but now believe it is god's plan the expedition will succeed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800545</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew has its sceptics,&lt;/b&gt; even though the exorcism seems at first to have worked. Two days later a sailor cries, 'It had glowing yellow eyes!' upon having sighted the demon near the hold. The unholy thing must be caught.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800546</GUID><Text>Bait the thing with food</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800547</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is nothing so savage.&lt;/b&gt; All are concealed around the strip of meat, expecting the worst. But what descends from the rafters of the hold, silent and gentle winged, is a luminous white owl. It is an ambiguous omen, according to those that know, but the sailors are content to keep it aboard.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800548</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Whatever it is, it is far too clever.&lt;/b&gt; It avoids the bait, but continues its night raids. Rumour this is an offended Klabautermann are substantiated by several separate accounts. Little voices overheard, brief sightings, even the discovery of a miniature table and chair. Some can live with the impish nuisance, but many will jump ship at the next port..</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800549</GUID><Text>Build a trap to catch the thing</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800550</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The cage-trap is well-made,&lt;/b&gt; and daybreak reveals an unlikely specimen encaged. 'A sort of badger?' is the first analysis, which in actuality, is fairly far from the mark. The compendium of animalia in the ship's library reveals it a 'northern raccoon', also remarking that is 'quite edible.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800551</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The snapping trap is weak and flimsy.&lt;/b&gt; The crew are excited by a sharp sound, but rush to the scene, only to find the bait gone, and the trap in disrepair. A piece of bright red felt caught in the spring explains all. 'Klabautermann!' they despair, for it is a terrible omen to offend a sea goblin as they have done.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800552</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew don't have much belief,&lt;/b&gt; and the priest makes a hash of the exorcism. If anything, his fragmented delivery only agitates the creature. The next night, a sailor is adamant he has sighted something 'irrefutably demonic.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800554</GUID><Text>Gather arms and confront it</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800557</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Rather excessive.&lt;/b&gt; The soldiery tense as strange noises draw near. Fingers itch upon triggers. The moment demon wings flap into view, the night is lit up with powder. Finally the smoke subsides, and the mangled thing is revealed to be nothing more than a bat. Troops thunder heavily about the ship, before discovering the rest of the hog-nosed critters in the hold. Everyone is left feeling utterly stupid.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800558</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your lily-livered cowards quiver like jelly!&lt;/b&gt; Fear chokes them as they spin wildly about looking for something to shoot that they can't see. Two are so panicked they bump together, causing the other to suddenly fire. Shot hits an angelic young sailor, killing instantly. The night terror is gone, but has taken for payment the most undeserving of souls.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800555</GUID><Text>Sate the demon with a sacrificial offering</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800559</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A man's finger for a stowaway weasel!&lt;/b&gt; In good faith, a pious sailor volunteers the pinkie of his right hand as a votive offering. But at the smell of blood, it is a slinky little mustelid that appears. With the weasel caught and caged, the night terror is over, but the sailors will not forgive or forget the loss of a good man's finger.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800560</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Sacrilege!&lt;/b&gt; A prohibited tome is consulted, the vile solicitations of its pages consuming the crew! Unspeakable acts are performed upon a man, so that the demon can be assuaged. Yet still the menace remains, and worse, the crew's sacrificial victim bleeds out from his injuries.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800556</GUID><Text>Don't anger the creature further</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800561</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The practical joke is ruined.&lt;/b&gt; The bored sailors bemoan the pathetic response to their little entertainment. That the senior officers have been duped by an obvious ruse, makes all severely doubt their fitness to lead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800553</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The faithless crew never take any part of the exorcism seriously.&lt;/b&gt; 'What's the point of hocus-pocus when its but greedy sailors stealing?!' yells one man. Accusations fly between conspiracy theorists, until a violent brawl breaks out. At the next mooring, the injured parties desert your godless expedition.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800541</GUID><Text>Find the culprit</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800563</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sharp-nosed hunters pick up a scent.&lt;/b&gt; Pungent droppings demarcate a perimeter, in the centre of which is a crate with a hole. A sailor reaches his arm bravely in. There is a brief struggle, and a whine like the ones at night, before the troublemaker is pulled out. It is a common garden fox. The cunning little creature becomes the crew's talisman for the remainder of the expedition.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800564</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Hunters find tracks, but can't say what made them.&lt;/b&gt; The marks are indeed strange - disturbing almost. Claw marks that go deep in the decking, as if the unspeakable thing that made them was in some frenzy.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800566</GUID><Text>Smoke it out of hiding</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800569</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Reassuringly human coughing comes from within.&lt;/b&gt; It turns out you have a stowaway - a young girl wishing to escape a life of hardship. She is spirited., and the crew take to her quickly. She is given work to do, and food to eat. All believe she shall prove their good luck charm.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800567</GUID><Text>Build a trap to catch whatever it is</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800570</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Knowing its habits helps.&lt;/b&gt; The box is made to measure, and along with its clever latch, is placed where the fiend seems most often to be. The box is found in the morning, with a gigantic rat inside it. The trap appears to have killed it, and that is the end of the matter.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800571</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ramshackle trap box is in bits the next morning.&lt;/b&gt; While to some they appear benign, the claw marks appear more frequently. Once a man wakes with his cheeks gouged. Some are so perturbed by the night demon, that they slink off the ship at the next available harbour.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800568</GUID><Text>Pray together against the spirit</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800572</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A feeling of calm descends upon the crew.&lt;/b&gt; The prayer seems to fill the spiritual void in the sailor's breasts. Approaching the world with a new perspective means even if the unexplained episodes at night persist, they pay it no mind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800573</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The communal prayer is broken by more wild shrieking.&lt;/b&gt; It matters not that, apart from vanishing supplies, the mischievous spirit seems fairly harmless. The crew are deeply troubled, and worry their souls are lost.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800565</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hunters stumble guilelessly into its trap.&lt;/b&gt; The night is unfeasibly pitch, and the hunters' lamps extinguish. Who knows why, without a breath of wind? A scratching draws near. Then a commotion... and screaming, followed by silence.  Just like that, the fiend  has gone forever, returning to the air whence it came. Three men lie dead in their own blood. Their livers have been removed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800542</GUID><Text>Ignore the menace</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800574</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The menace is very persistent.&lt;/b&gt; Restless nights, devoured food, and stolen supplies shall go unexplained and unresolved for the remainder of the expedition. The crew are at their wit's end.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800972</GUID><Text>Baptism of Fire</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800973</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Everything points towards the foreboding gate.&lt;/b&gt; Salvation lies beyond, but the eerie blue flame that suffuses it keep the crew at a distance. Perhaps it would be safer to find a way through the surrounding jungle, but those of faith say the gate is 'an auspicious sign'.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800974</GUID><Text>Have the scientist look at the gate</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800975</GUID><Text>Have faith and leap through the flames.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800976</GUID><Text>Wrap up before leaping through the flames.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800977</GUID><Text>Cut through the jungle instead</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800978</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The scientist banishes the illusion.&lt;/b&gt; 'This fire that you perceive around the gate, is simply the agglomeration of azure glow-worms.' Laughter becomes delight, as the party take the pulsing creatures in hand. This is the wonder of nature.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800979</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;If anything the flames are cool&lt;/b&gt;, almost like bundles of ribbons brushing the skin. This gate is, without question, an earthly manifestation of the divine. Ahead, an extremely hospitable settlement affirms the holy blessing.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800980</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doubtful crew are surprised.&lt;/b&gt; Drawing closer to the gate, they find the flames seem to give off no heat. One leap of faith and they are through! Still they hesitate, for a perfect skeleton sits propped against it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800981</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Fire and brimstone!&lt;/b&gt; The heat is intense, but your procession of false prophets seem numb to the pain. The others watch horrified, as fabric, skin and flesh renders before their eyes. If the expedition continues, it will only be for the mercy of god.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800982</GUID><Text>Determine how the person died</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800983</GUID><Text>Order them to charge through!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800984</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor forms a reasonable hypothesis&lt;/b&gt;, but cannot be absolutely sure from bone alone. 'The way they sit suggests they lacked the will to continue.' Not wishing to end the same way, the crew are astonished to discover that leaping through the gate does them no harm.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800985</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor's career is over.&lt;/b&gt; As are the careers of those who heed his words. 'Came through from the other side, but it was not the fire that took him'. As they jump, flames grasp their ankles, and rapidly shoot up and over the rest.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800986</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Ouch!'&lt;/b&gt; The men yelp, rolling in the dirt until they are sure they are no longer afire. The strange arch behind them, your brave soldiers compare their battle scars.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800987</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Cowards!'&lt;/b&gt; Your men lack the military discipline to follow a simple order! You will have to find another way.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800988</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They make it.&lt;/b&gt; Rolled-up like carpets they skip through the flaming gate. Their worst complaint is the sweet and overwhelming pong of sweat that now follows them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800989</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'That they died as sausages!&lt;/b&gt; or what shall we tell their families!?' Perhaps dousing their mantles in a protective layer of paraffin was a mistake! Your expedition continues to turn on its spit.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800990</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew have no regrets&lt;/b&gt; in plotting such a rational course. Sweaty jungles are the devil they know, crawling with tentacle limb and spider fang. But who knew what sorcery governed that strange gate?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800991</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The jungle thins out to a precipice.&lt;/b&gt; A long and shoddy-looking bridge stretches to the other side, or else you could attempt to find a way around.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800992</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No way through,&lt;/b&gt; thanks to your shambolic mapreading. The group becomes separated, and eventually lost. Hacking those ancient and contorted roots has saved no time that couldn't be saved by backtrack, and cost you several lives into the bargain.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800993</GUID><Text>Inspect the bridge</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800994</GUID><Text>Circumnavigate the cliff</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800995</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is in passable condition.&lt;/b&gt; There are a few nerve-wracking moments, as the wind whips the bridge into a vigorous sway, and all are rather pleased to reach the other side. Your expedition continues.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800996</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Most treacherous!&lt;/b&gt; The confidence of your craftsmen in the rickety structure couldn't be more misplaced. Of course it is nothing if not dramatic, when the bridge cables twang, and one after the other pile into the gorge.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800997</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is a long trek&lt;/b&gt;, that could have been much longer but for the competence of those with a compass. Yet another hiccup for the expedition log book.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800998</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Imbecile orienteers!&lt;/b&gt; There is no other way across this river valley for a hundred miles! You have covered half that distance before you realise, wasting a lot of time and provisions.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802269</GUID><Text>Songs Under the Sea</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802270</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The lookout is sure of himself: he saw a mermaid.&lt;/b&gt; Despite the burning sun of noon, sailors pile up against the ship's handrails and inspect the mirror waters for more signs of the creature. At last, they glimpse its silver tail and hear its song, a mesmerizing chant which beckons them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802272</GUID><Text>Have an expert examine the apparition</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802274</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The mermaid is half-fish, half-fish.&lt;/b&gt; The scientist orchestrates a careful operation to retrieve the animal from the ocean, sending divers underwater to lure and catch the creature by playing with it. The miniature whale enjoys singing with your sailors for the rest of the trip.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802275</GUID><Text>Answer the mermaid with a sailing chant</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802276</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Not one, but a dozen mermaids answer the chant.&lt;/b&gt; As your crew sings of their country ruling the waves and their patriots never being slaves, the marine creatures react joyfully and surround the ship, jumping along its sides. These animals are no mermaids. They're frisky little whales!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802277</GUID><Text>Try to catch one of them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802278</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An effortless catch for your fishermen.&lt;/b&gt; Taking care not to hurt the beautiful creatures, the sailors casts multiple nets in the water and retrieve an individual from the pack, quickly transferring it to one of your wildlife aquariums. The animal seems to enjoy the constant attention and the free food, and the crew falls in love with the playful "mermaid."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802279</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your fishermen are not used to catching fish alive.&lt;/b&gt; They cast a weighted nest among the pack, but as they try to pull it up the animal slips out, its tangled flipper striped with thin red lines. The creatures flee underwater, leaving the sailors longing for their song.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802280</GUID><Text>Leave the creatures be</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802281</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The moment is otherworldly.&lt;/b&gt; The creatures dance among the waves, tweeting and clicking in response to your sailors' cheers, jumping higher with each new verse sung by their human admirers. Their ballet and innocent happiness is well worth the absence of mermaids.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802282</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The mermaid vanishes.&lt;/b&gt; The crew sings with more passion than prowess, and the creature itself doesn't deign to answer. When at last their breath is short, the sailors mourn the disappearance of the mermaid and waste more time dreaming up her sisters and their underwater kingdoms.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802283</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A sailor jumps into the ocean!&lt;/b&gt; Unfazed by the crew's heartfelt singing and longing for her, the mermaid flips her tail, teasing and staying underwater. Spurred by the chanting, one of your men leaps into the sea and is now gurgling and splashing in a parody of swimming technique, desperate to follow the creature.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802284</GUID><Text>Go after the mermaid and the drifting sailor</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802285</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Close enough for one last glimpse of the mermaid.&lt;/b&gt; The ship slides aside the creature and the frenzied sailor swimming after it. The mermaid splashes her tail at her stalker and disappears, allowing the fallen man to be dragged back onboard, where he is immediately pressed by jealous questions. Alas, the sailor saw little of the frightened creature and its true form remains a mystery.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802286</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The maneuver sends the ship crashing against both man and mermaid.&lt;/b&gt; Too eager to catch up with the beautiful creature, several sailors grapple the steering wheel and fight to guide the ship, oblivious to the alarmed instructions of their officers. The iron prow crushes the mermaid and her follower. When they come to their senses, the sailors are not punished: their horror and shame is sanction enough.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802287</GUID><Text>Let the fool face his fate</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802288</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The smitten sailor drowns.&lt;/b&gt; The man paddles against the light waves, his skull going in and out of the water, his lips moving feverishly and the sea sounds keeping his words for themselves. When his head doesn't resurface, the sailors know the mermaid had nothing to do with it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802289</GUID><Text>Convince the sailors of ignoring the creature</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802290</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Discipline is stronger than fascination.&lt;/b&gt; Galvanized by the orders of their officers, the sailors ignore the mermaid's calls and leave it behind, fulfilling their duty. They feel like heroes of ancient tales in the face of mystical temptations and the epic trial makes them shiver in pride.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802291</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Fascination gets the better of your crew's discipline.&lt;/b&gt; The men ignore all orders and deliberate among themselves, planning the best approach to catch the mermaid's attention. The officers cannot accept this undermining of their authority, and get the whips ready.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802293</GUID><Text>Give the dissidents a good flogging</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802294</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Action commands respect.&lt;/b&gt; Four of the most unruly sailors are dragged to the stern, tied in kneeling positions, and flogged until their shirts are drenched. Acceptance spreads within the crew as their minds clear, and they resume their duties knowing that this expedition will tolerate no mischief. The mermaid was a nice but short-lived dream.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802295</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The flogging exceeds discipline and goes overboard.&lt;/b&gt; Instead of organizing a session of punishment, with explicit rules, blames and sanctions, the officers chastise at will, whipping whoever is within reach, spitting their anger in unintelligible tirades. When they calm down, the dissidents are a mass of sweat, blood, and whimpers. The mermaid cries in the distance as the crew resumes its duties.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802296</GUID><Text>Drop the issue and let them be</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802297</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Discipline aboard this ship is lax.&lt;/b&gt; Convinced that their misconduct can go unpunished, the sailors take to ignore or bargain the officers' orders, and "mermaid" becomes a keyword to rally against tedious instructions. This behaviour plagues the rest of the trip.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802381</GUID><Text>The Devil Calls</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802382</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Human voices call through the uninhabited rainforest.&lt;/b&gt; With each new step through the humid air and dense trees, the sailors unconsciously stand closer to their priest. Rumours of the evil one's presence made them laugh when protected by the comfort of the ship but investigating the forest itself is something else. As a child's voice babbles in the distance, the priest urges the sailors to ignore it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802383</GUID><Text>Have your zoologist inspect the surroundings</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802386</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors were lured by the song of a bird.&lt;/b&gt; Through careful scrutiny of the rainforest's ground, the zoologist finds a curious brown ball hopping under the fern, its tail spread into aerial and colourful feathers. What they heard wasn't the call of the devil, but the mating song of a bird. Amazed by the creature's ability to perfectly replicate human voice, the sailors eagerly capture it to share its marvels with the world.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802384</GUID><Text>Ignore the voice as the priest advises</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802387</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The priest's advice works.&lt;/b&gt; Blocking their ears and closing their hearts to the crying voice, the sailors run from the cursed place. When they allow themselves to hear again, the voices are gone and their faith is renewed, stronger than ever. Whether this call was the devil's or not, their resistance is worth celebrating.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802388</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The voice is too persistent to be ignored.&lt;/b&gt; The youthful cries haunt the sailors, and they advance through the rainforest half wanting to understand its cause, half wishing they never do. They try to light torches to reveal the evil, but the damp atmosphere snuffs them out. As day advances and nights steps in, so does the voice get closer to the men.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802389</GUID><Text>Have the priest face the invisible menace</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802391</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The priest's voice is louder than the devil's.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;"Surely God is my salvation,&lt;/br&gt;I will trust and not be afraid.&lt;/br&gt;The Lord, the Lord himself, is my strength and my defence, He has become my salvation."&lt;/br&gt;The priest's chant resonates through the moist air, reverberating deep into the forest's darkness. Whether there was evil to be fought or not, the holy chant certainly silenced its call.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802392</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The priest's attempts do not match the menace.&lt;/b&gt; As he anoints each sailor with hastily blessed water, a voice identical to his laughs from the depths of the forest. After a night spent without light nor sleep, the sailors realize several of them are missing. They will never know if this was desertion or abduction.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802390</GUID><Text>Run away to the ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802393</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The devil's call is covered by the sailors' screams.&lt;/b&gt; They hurtle down the rainforest with the speed of possessed men and rush inside the ship, desperate for its protection. They can never quite explain their misadventure, and become a regular targets of jokes for those who did not hear the devil.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802385</GUID><Text>Ignore the advice and look for a rational explanation</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802394</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hunters patiently let the voice come to them.&lt;/b&gt; Knowing better than to ruffle through the thick vegetation and scare the wildlife away, the sailors stay still until a bird no bigger than a fist emerges from the fern and tweets excitedly, emitting the songs of a variety of other birds, along with human noises and voices. Delighted, the hunters decide to bring the little marvel back onboard.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802395</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors are not discreet hunters.&lt;/b&gt; They rummage through the forest, so mindful of the voice they lack focus. A man walks on a tail and the giant lizard it belongs to jerks out of its leafy camouflage, rushing to climb a bystander as if it were a tree. Reacting to the movement, more beasts emerge from the ground and attack, their bites causing profuse bleeding and screaming. The crew flees in horror, convinced of the devil's presence.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802397</GUID><Text>The Treasure of Hassan Ben Sahid</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802398</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Are you ready for real treasure hunting?&lt;/b&gt; What was set to be a routine stop at an inland tavern turned out to have a much grander potential: an elder invited your crew to join her on her hunt for the cache of the corsair Hassan Ben Sahid. The find is all she needs, she says, and she'd gladly trade the satisfaction of ending a lifelong quest against the treasure itself. Your crew bursts in excitement. A pirate treasure!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802399</GUID><Text>Follow the beckoning elder</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802401</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The complete trust of your crew puts the old woman at ease.&lt;/b&gt; A youthful spark lights her eyes as she drags your men through the town and into her hideout, a shack whose walls and floor are covered in travelling gear for all weathers. The only furniture of the place is a table which displays a map crumbling from too much usage. The plan is old and its indications are coded, the woman points out, but she's already worked out a link with the current town.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802403</GUID><Text>Decode the map's indications</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802405</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Knowledge of tongues can make texts talk.&lt;/b&gt; Your diplomats work their way through the cyphers, piecing Oriental alphabets together with Latin grammatical logic. The indications do point to the current region, but rather than a precise location, the deciphered text offers an enigma:&lt;/br&gt;"Hassan Ben Sahid salutes you with his last breath.&lt;/br&gt;Upon you the gifts of true solace and rebirth,&lt;/br&gt;While I lay asleep in the lavish lap of earth.&lt;/br&gt;May mercy find you despite my earliest death."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802407</GUID><Text>This is spiritual: go inspect the local church</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802409</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The treasure of Hassan Ben Sahid!&lt;/b&gt; The old explorer leads your crew to the church. A sailor, muttering about Ben Sahid's riddle of solace and rebirth, scrutinizes the Christ crucified above the altar and soon finds a loose stone in the wall behind it. Brick by brick the wall is dismantled to reveal rusty iron daggers, ancient silver chalices, shinning gold coins. As the old woman marvels over the Moor pirate's piety and the end of her quest, she insists that the treasure be your crew's.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802410</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;If there is a treasure to be found, it's not here.&lt;b&gt; The old woman leads your sailors to the local church and they inspect the weathered building and its surrounding, but they don't see what Ben Sahid's riddle about rebirth may mean. Perhaps they simply lack the knowledge needed? The search is vain and the crew settles on enjoying the old explorer's tales of adventure, as both her and the sailors try to ignore their lingering feeling of near-accomplishment.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802408</GUID><Text>This is straightforward: go inspect the cemetery</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802411</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The treasure of Hassan Ben Sahid!&lt;/b&gt; Both crew and old explorer inspect every single tomb, looking for the solution to the pirate's riddle. At last a sailor points out a grave bearing not two, but a single year: an infant dead before it could live - or, as Ben Sahid put it, the earliest death. Instead of a corpse, they find jewels and gold in the casket. The old woman weeps before the end of her quest, takes a single gem, and gracefully invites your crew to take the treasure.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802412</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The search is fruitless.&lt;/b&gt; The graves all look the same. Knowing the solution lies in the pirate's riddle and its mention of the earliest death, the crew tries to find the most ancient tomb, but with age comes erosion and the dates are barely legible - this is not what the riddle meant. The sailors are forced to abandon this dead end and settle on the idea that this is as far as anyone ever got to Hassan Ben Sahid's treasure.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802406</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The texts refuse to speak to the crew.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors inspect the ink, place mirrors in front of what could be letters, bring a flame so close it could burn the wrinkled paper, and trigger the ire of the old explorer. She ushers the brutish crew away from her precious plan and thanks them cooly: next time, they should show more adequacy for the task they're attempting. She closes her door on her hideout and the promise of treasure.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802404</GUID><Text>Match the map to the surrounding landscape</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802413</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A treasure cache!&lt;/b&gt; Following the coast's silhouette and how it transcribes to the map, the sailors manage to find what places Hassan Ben Sahid found worthy of his time: the local church, a former red district and a suspiciously plain cliff above the sea. Indeed, the cliff is slit by a large opening which leads to a cave where the crew finds scattered riches - maybe not the full extent of the pirate's treasure, but a remarkable find nonetheless.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802414</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew finds nothing but rocks and grasshoppers.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors engage on a hunt to match any coastline, forest or flower bush to the map's drawings. In a final attempt to uncover Ben Sahid's cache, a sailor overturns a stone that absolutely looked like it belonged to the plan and discovers a simmering campfire: the insects grilling over the coals make for a weird, if enjoyable reward, but they are far from the promised riches.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802402</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hag leads your crew into a trap!&lt;/b&gt; Before they can realize how misplaced their trust was, the sailors are stuck between the sides of a narrow alley, armed men in front, armed men in back. They make it clear that the only treasure they're looking for is yours.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802415</GUID><Text>Attack the crooks</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802417</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors are the ones who do the beatings.&lt;/b&gt; Acting like one, they fire before the cutpurses can react and overwhelm them in a matter of minutes, getting the bandits to beg for their lives. The taste of victory is dampened by how effortless it was to fool the crew, and they regain the ship with sour moods.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802418</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors are defeated without difficulty.&lt;/b&gt; The members of this crew are not fighters to begin with and their lack of ability shows in their poor coordination, whereas the bandits' organization is almost military-like. They suppress your sailors without a second thought, and the rare survivors are left to plod back to their ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802416</GUID><Text>Surrender some of your possessions</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802419</GUID><Text>The thugs watch as your crew empties their pockets.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802420</GUID><Text>Accept</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802422</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You trade several goods against safe passage.&lt;/b&gt; Trade is a strong word for this parody of consent, and your sailors feel ridiculed. They blame themselves for having believed in these tall tales of pirate treasures and leave with a little less belief in the extraordinary.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802421</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802423</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What the crew offers is far from enough.&lt;/b&gt; The old woman barely glances at the goods presented to her before flicking her wrist, triggering a rain of bullets onto the sailors. When she snaps her fingers to signal the end of the assault, your would-be adventurers are either wounded or dead. The survivors drag themselves back to the ship and rumours of treasures can never excite them again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802400</GUID><Text>Ignore the promise of riches</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802424</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Tales of pirate treasures belong to another century.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew ignores the pleading woman and leave to spend the night in the ship, their dreams filled with fantasies of glittering jewels and untold fortunes. When they depart at dawn, there is a longing in their eyes.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802426</GUID><Text>Wood Keeper</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802427</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The indigenous village is filled with food but deserted.&lt;/b&gt; After a smooth beaching on the shore, the crew enters the camp of wooden huts: there they find numerous fruits arranged in neat and symmetric piles, and their dried-meat regimen make them eye the fresh food with envy. Not a single villager is in sight.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802428</GUID><Text>Try to guess the meaning of the food's peculiar arrangement</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802431</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The patterns of the offerings converge to a hut.&lt;/b&gt; The crew follows the lines of fruits to the biggest hut, where they find a massive statue of wood lying in the dust. Its weathered edges must have seen many generations.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802434</GUID><Text>Address the statue for lack of another representative</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802437</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The praying crew is rewarded with a new path.&lt;/b&gt; Several sailors bow down to the statue, in a awkward but respectful manner. The only man able to look directly at the wooden figure notices that the hut's panels behind the statue, which he could have sworn were a solid wall, are not fully closed. Their illusory arrangement cleverly hid a path leading into the woods.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802439</GUID><Text>Piece together the clues to understand the village's ritual</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802442</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your anthropologist retraces the exact steps of the ritual.&lt;/b&gt; To appease their god, probably after the wooden statue fell, the villagers staged a path, probably with the fruits, to lead the god to a prize befitting its anger, probably in this dead trunk right behind the hut. The expert plunges her hand in the bark and retrieves an amulet of woven leaves and fruits. The crew takes it upon itself to make amulet and offerings disappear, confirming that the spirits are appeased.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802440</GUID><Text>Explore the woods surrounding the hut</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802443</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew's careful exploration lands a wondrous find.&lt;/b&gt; In the trunk of a tree standing right behind the hut, they find an intricate amulet made of vines and fruits which glistens like a jewel. Marveling at their lucky discovery and entering endless debates to guess the meaning of what they saw, they help themselves to the fresh fruits and leave the village.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802444</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Nothing of interest is found.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors enjoy the beautiful flora, wondering what secrets could hide behind the village's strange appearance. They cannot help but think they have missed something and leave with some of the fresh fruits as a consolation prize.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802441</GUID><Text>Reject the invitation and leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802445</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They will have none of this mystical nonsense.&lt;/b&gt; The crew hurries away from the wooden figure and focuses on picking a good amount of food before heading back onboard. They know where their priorities are and ignore the unanswered questions that linger among them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802438</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The statue doesn't react to any prayer.&lt;/b&gt; A sailor, cross necklace in hand, approaches the wooden figure and mumbles. A salute. An improvised prayer. After a long and unnerving silence, he turns to his mates and confirms that the statue is not answering. Several men utter nervous laughs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802435</GUID><Text>Lift the statue back up</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802446</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The statue is successfully pulled back up.&lt;/b&gt; It is even more impressive in its original position and dominates the room. Sunrays pierce through the hut's roof and fall on the statue, highlighting its uncanny shape and smearing its shadow on the back entrance of the hut.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802447</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The statue doesn't budge.&lt;/b&gt; As many men as hands can fit on the wooden figure surround the statue and attempt to lift it, to no avail. A sailor wonders if the thing wasn't carved from a standing tree with roots still holding it in place.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802436</GUID><Text>Leave this cursed place</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802451</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They will have none of this mystical nonsense.&lt;/b&gt; The crew hurries away from the wooden figure and focuses on picking a good amount of food before heading back onboard. They know where their priorities are and ignore the unanswered questions that linger among them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802432</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew shows little respect towards the offerings.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors turn over and forage through the piles of fruits, looking for hints of logic in the strange setup. When the villagers appear, drawn by the noise, they are baffled by the mess and immediately draw spears.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802452</GUID><Text>Draw swords and brace for the assault</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802454</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew acts as a well-oiled and heartless machine.&lt;/b&gt; Years of military training and fighting together make the villagers' assault look puny in comparison, and the attackers are repelled and slaughtered - less than a handful manages to escape. The sailors collect what fruit hasn't been squashed during the fight, and leave without a second thought.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802455</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's a rout.&lt;/b&gt; The crew ruins its formation when the villagers attack, and men scatter in all directions save for a line of headstrong sailors. They manage to repel the attackers and pay their unpredictable success with their lives. When those who fled climb back aboard the ship, they carry stolen supplies and the bodies of their fallen protectors.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802453</GUID><Text>Do not attack and attempt an apology</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802456</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors manage to communicate through signs and gesticulations.&lt;/b&gt; Two men put in extra effort to mime their hunger and delight at the sight of the fruit piles, rubbing their bellies and humming eating sounds. The villagers answer in a perfectly intelligible language and their laughter follows the crew as it leaves for the ship, supplies in hand.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802457</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew raises their hands and withdraws.&lt;/b&gt; A village elder drops the tip of his spear to the ground and the warriors around him do the same. They do not blink as they survey the crew's retreat. Slowly, carefully, without abrupt movement, the sailors walk backward, out of the village, and into the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802458</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Few sailors manage to keep it together.&lt;/b&gt; The most resolute raise their hands before the armed villagers, who in turn raise their spears and hoot. The crew breaks in response, groups of terrified men fleeing in all directions and getting skewered by the villagers' lances. Those who did not run are spared and sent back to the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802433</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What is happening here is not of God's realm.&lt;/b&gt; The crew progresses through the village, too obsessed with the hypnotic patterns of offerings to see the spears coming. Villagers pour from the surrounding woods, hooting and screaming and assailing, and the sailors flee back to the ship in a frenzied panic. They leave before all could it back onboard.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802429</GUID><Text>Send a party to look for the missing villagers</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802461</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A watchful lookout spots the villagers before they attack.&lt;/b&gt; The crew is warned and the men have more than enough time to get ready to welcome their armed hosts: they prey onto them and not a single sailor is lost. The villagers who surrender are left alive and the crew accepts several supplies against their magnanimity.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802462</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The villagers are found as they attack.&lt;/b&gt; A lookout spots the attackers as they run towards the village, and he barely has the time to warn the crew before the warriors dive onto them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802463</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The villagers find the sailors before they are found.&lt;/b&gt; As the extended absence of the lookouts starts to worry the crew, ballots of canvas roll from the woods: presents containing the heads of the missing men. Hooting sounds emerge from the trees and rise in power as the men run away in terror before their invisible assailants.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802430</GUID><Text>Take the food quickly and leave with it</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802468</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew's carelessness allows the attack.&lt;/b&gt; As soon as one of the sailors touches the fruits, a hooting shout resonates around the village and men and women dressed in sticks, creepers and vines appear around the crew. Arrows and spears rain on the sailors who scatter in a panic and flee to the ship, empty-handed and badly wounded.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802546</GUID><Text>Apostasy</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802547</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Little cohabitation can be found among believers and apostates.&lt;/b&gt; To ensure the diversity of your crew's skills, your sailors were recruited regardless of their origins or beliefs, and your lieutenants now wonder if this was a mistake. After weeks of lasting rainstorms, the most devout sailors raise their voice: this constant punishment is a sign of the divine, testifying to His obvious displeasure in the heresy onboard. Zealots speak of riot.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802550</GUID><Text>Consult the Norse Sagas on the matter</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802556</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Old Norse has much wisdom to share.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;“Men brave and generous live the best lives, seldom will they sorrow; then there are fools, afraid of everything, who grumble instead of giving.”&lt;/br&gt;Snorri's Edda is a gentle but firm reminder to your sailors that their grievances are shallow and foolish. No agreement is voiced that night, but all know that an understanding is born.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802549</GUID><Text>Consult The Odyssey on the matter</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802557</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Odyssey's wisdom seeps into your sailors' souls.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;"For a friend with an understanding heart is worth no less than a brother."&lt;/br&gt;Gathered around the first mate for an improvised reading session, the sailors can't ignore how the tale of friendship reminds them of their own adventures, of their own mistakes, of their own companions. Difference in faith is a detail. Their unity is what prevails.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802548</GUID><Text>Consult The Illiad on the matter</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802558</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Mythical tales give a lesson to your crew.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;"Come then, let us give each other glorious presents, so that any of the Achaians or Trojans may say of us: 'These two fought each other in heart-consuming hate, then joined with each other in close friendship.'"&lt;/br&gt;Hector's speech reminds your sailors of the values that bond them in this expedition: thrill, friendship, discovery, not anger nor fratricide over different beliefs. They sheepishly make up.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802553</GUID><Text>Consult Skaldic poetry on the matter</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802559</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The epic poem puts your crew's petty fights in perspective.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;"The battle continued from day to day; and all they who fell, and all the swords that lay on the field of battle, and all the shields, became stone."&lt;/br&gt;The crew itself is petrified as it hangs onto the first mate's every word while he progresses through the poems of the Skáldskaparmál. The tale transports them to a time where pride had a greater value than faith, and their anger goes out.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802552</GUID><Text>Consult an ancient romance on the matter</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802560</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors bond in their love of a great tale.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;“For love will cure him that is sick, and rouse him that is in dumps; one that has loved, it will remember of it; one that has not, it will instruct."&lt;/br&gt;The first mate closes his novel, leaving the crew to ponder over the fate of Daphnis and Chloe. The sailors, moved by their love, find themselves wiping tears over the story. The shared emotion gives them a common ground during which they can pretend their differences do not exist.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802551</GUID><Text>Consult the Egyptian tales on the matter</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802561</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's a mystifying wisdom in the Egyptian Book of the Dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Although no exact quote can be extracted from the detailed drawings, the translator's work in dissecting the Ptolemaic manuscript manages to build texts akin to the original meaning. Your sailors' trivial quarrels reveal their narrow-minded nature as the first mate unravels tales of fratricide and weighed souls. The tensions loosen as much as they can.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802554</GUID><Text>Convince the apostates to come back to the light</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802562</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There is relief in promised forgiveness.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;"For the Lord your God is gracious and compassionate. He will not turn his face from you if you return to him."&lt;/br&gt;The priest's words are filled with his own altruism and make the promise ring true. The crew agrees, albeit awkwardly, to put aside their differences and engage in a calm exchange over their beliefs - the anger is quelled, but the heresy remains.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802563</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your priest's ideals are far from peaceful.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;"If your friend who is as your own soul entices you secretly, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods,' your hand shall be first against him to put him to death!"&lt;/br&gt;The menace embodies what the apostates criticise: a blind upholding of beliefs at the cost of your own humanity. The zealous priest is found hanged the next day - a warning to all who would chastise one's faith or lack of it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802555</GUID><Text>Convince the zealots into accepting their differences</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802564</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat finds the right words.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;"God is a circle whose center is everywhere and circumference nowhere."&lt;/br&gt;The quote is surprising coming from the woman of law, who manages to put aside her own beliefs to show respect for the zealots' faith. The crew listens intently and all agree that the expedition might be the occasion to discover and appreciate the beliefs of others, despite a sustained atmosphere of skepticism.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802565</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The diplomat finds no common ground with the zealots.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;"When it is a question of money, everyone is of the same religion!"&lt;/br&gt;The argument is as wrong as it is insulting. Does the man not think that sailors embarked on the expedition for more than their pay? His lack of respect rouses the anger of the zealots, drawing the attention away from the apostates. Nothing more than a shift in the target of their hatred.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800467</GUID><Text>Love Island</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800468</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A matter of the heart.&lt;/b&gt; The crew have been enjoying some island hospitality, but many are now refusing to leave. They have fallen in love with the sons and daughters of the local king. Perhaps he can be convinced to allow them to come with you? You can attempt to come to an arrangement, or else wait for him to consult his copper oracle.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800470</GUID><Text>Offer a wedding gift</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800474</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The king is not only surprised,&lt;/b&gt; but moved to tears by the romantic composers he hears via the gramophone. He insists on a grand banquet to celebrate the union of his children and your crew. Both traditional music and a few cranks of the new-fangled gramophone accompany the beautiful ceremony, and then its bon voyage!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800471</GUID><Text>Convince the king your crew's affection is genuine</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800475</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The king is delighted to see his children wed.&lt;/b&gt; Delicate understanding of local custom and a smattering of their language allow a message of true love to be conveyed. The king evidently thinks his children in good hands. Feasting, and to the amusement of all, terrible dancing, follows. For his departing children, it shall be the longest, most fascinating honeymoon.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800476</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Something is lost in translation.&lt;/b&gt; Yet the king smiles benignly, as if your crew still have a chance to prove themselves. 'He suggests a great hunt,' says your diplomat, 'or else we may await arcane judgment.' His eyes flick to a copper oracle on a dais.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800478</GUID><Text>Capture the king a prize animal</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800480</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hunt goes quite well.&lt;/b&gt; Beautiful boars inhabit the woods, and though tricky to catch, are little trouble for your experts. Though the king will still not allow you to leave with his children, the feast of boar brings everyone together in the moment. The lovers understand this moment is all they have, and the next morning there is an acceptance that it is time to part ways.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800481</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hunt is not perfect.&lt;/b&gt; The crew show courage in pursuit of a tiger, which draws the king's admiration. Sadly, they cannot catch it, which leaves the king wondering if your men will be able to provide once married. Thus, he decides not to let his children leave. Some of your crew remain committed to staying behind, and it is with regret you must continue without them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800482</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your naive hunters fail the test.&lt;/b&gt; Forest deer are everywhere, and hunting them hardly seems a challenge. Had your so-named 'hunters' any respect for nature, they'd have realised the sacred deer were not what the king was after. Instead they gather them up greedily. The king makes it perfectly clear your expedition must move on. With heavy hearts, the sailors return to the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800479</GUID><Text>Face the verdict of the copper oracle</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800483</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The oracle predicts a reassuring fate for all.&lt;/b&gt; Those who wish to remain for love will live fulfilling lives, but the same shall be true for those still committed to your expedition. All parties feel a sense of peace. Your voyage shall continue without any resentment towards those it leaves behind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800484</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle is disappointingly undecided.&lt;/b&gt; The king cannot, in good faith, allow his children to leave to an uncertain destiny. His ultimatum is that your crew become part of his extensive family or else they must leave alone. Though understandable, it is nevertheless regrettable when some decide to stay behind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800485</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle predicts that your souls cannot be saved.&lt;/b&gt; With your crew rotten to the core, the king makes it clear there can be no union with his children, and that you are no longer welcome. Heart-broken and bearing the burden of sin, the crew return to the triviality of duty.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800477</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The awkward gestures and diagrams in the sand&lt;/b&gt; prove highly offensive to the king and his people. Sensing outrage, the crew back away towards the ship. The angry locals fire arrows at their former amours. Fittingly, one is struck in the heart, and bleeds out into the brine. The rest return lovelorn, to their dreary maps and compasses.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800472</GUID><Text>Await the verdict of the copper oracle</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800486</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle sees only purity in your crew's hearts.&lt;/b&gt; It predicts a bounteous future for the king's children, and so with tearful pride, he gives the couples his blessing. The traditional ceremony is both spiritually uplifting and wholesome.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800487</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle reveals a little doubt in your crew's hearts.&lt;/b&gt; The king interprets that his children will only be happy if they remain on the island., and that some of your sailors are not in love, but merely infatuated. Still, you must lose the fine crew who have formed genuine bonds.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800488</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle reveals great doubt in your crew's hearts.&lt;/b&gt; The king does not for a minute believe that your inconstant crew are as deep in love as they claim. If they cannot demonstrate otherwise, it might be better if your people left.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800490</GUID><Text>Try to convince the king your crew is worthy</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800492</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Careful diplomacy has him thinking twice.&lt;/b&gt; Perhaps there is a way for the crew to prove themselves. A lean champion steps forward. Fighting him may impress the king, or else you can try and outhunt him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800494</GUID><Text>Propose a contest of champions</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800496</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You have your champions.&lt;/b&gt; One-by-one the suitors fight the king's champion. Those who prevail, it turns out, are permitted to take their lovers to sea. Some fail, but can at least drown their sorrows during the farewell celebration that follows.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800497</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is not a pleasant sight for the faint of heart.&lt;/b&gt; Your best champion is put forward, and subsequently knocked about the head for the entirety of the contest. At the end a cloth is needed to conceal the disfigured face. The king expresses his condolences for your loss, but all is fair in love and war.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800495</GUID><Text>Propose a hunting competition</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800498</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is close but the king's champion is outfoxed.&lt;/b&gt; By sundown your best hunter has claimed six boars to their five. The king will still not allow you to leave with his children, but the feast of boar brings everyone together in one moment. The lovers understand a moment is all they have, and the next morning there is an acceptance that it is time to part ways.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800499</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Lacking the skill, your hunters try to cheat.&lt;/b&gt; Without knowledge of the island's fauna, they decide to follow the king's hunters in the hope of poaching the animal they are tracking. But they are led a merry dance. Three days pass, and your champion is missing presumed dead. The crew have no choice but to depart, tail between their legs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800493</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The king is offended by your insolence.&lt;/b&gt; Without a word he boards a boat and heads out to sea. Some foolishly follow, believing he can be reasoned with, but they have even less knowledge of local boats than local customs. Their bodies will be dredged from the reef as your tactless expedition struggles on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800491</GUID><Text>Order the crew to leave at once</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800500</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Paradise lost!&lt;/b&gt; The expedition may be back underway, but the mood is abject as the beautiful island becomes but painful memory. Too painful for one, who is discovered dead, it is said, by way of a broken heart.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800489</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle proclaims your crew's hearts sinful and wicked.&lt;/b&gt; Arm-in-arm with their new-found amours, the sailors await some happy answer. But the moment the king's arm is raised, daggers unsheathe, plunging into the hearts of the would-be lovers. Speechless and unharmed, the rest are free to leave the island, pondering the grave cost of faithlessness.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800473</GUID><Text>Leave without the crew who've fallen in love</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800501</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is a significant blow.&lt;/b&gt; Any happiness the crew might feel at their comrades finding love is consumed by feelings of resentment. How could they have been so selfish? The expedition goes on, but those who are still a part must take on twice as much work.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800112</GUID><Text>Temple of the Monkey God</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800114</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;With water supplies so low&lt;/b&gt;, the sight of an island waterfall elicits a mighty cheer from the crew. But up close, high temple walls adorned with monkeys shield access to the water, and the temple entrance is obstructed by a crowd of devotees, deep in ritual.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800115</GUID><Text>Have [AssetData([ExpeditionEventRequirement]) Text] shed light on the meaning of the ritual</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800120</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Nothing to fear from this ritual,'&lt;/b&gt; beams the anthropologist, having consulted a bound volume entitled 'Creed of the Monkey God'. 'If I am correct, the devotees gather to disperse the malefic spirit of envy. It would be excellent form for us to join in.' At which remark, the crew begin to look a little hesitant.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800121</GUID><Text>Join the ritual</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800123</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Sure enough, the ritual unfolds into a jolly dance.&lt;/b&gt; With the shaking of rainsticks, and gentle swaying must come broad smiles, for this is how the monkey himself defeated the spirit of envy. A feast of grouse and soursop follows, and [AssetData([ExpeditionEventRequirement]) Text] is presented a monkey-tooth amulet as a gift. Next morning, fresh water is collected from the waterfall and having waved goodbye, the happy crew set sail.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800122</GUID><Text>Just ask to get some water</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800124</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;[AssetData([ExpeditionEventRequirement]) Text] negotiates the much needed-water&lt;/b&gt;, through a lengthy exchange of sound and gesture, not all of which the crew can be certain is relevant.

'Expurgation is God's work, and I am chosen.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801014</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The fire is chaotic&lt;/b&gt;, and the buckets of water seem not to extinguish, but provoke.

The blood shed on both sides will stain this ship and expedition forever.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801019</GUID><Text>Leave immediately.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801022</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Once your ship is underway she is free.&lt;/b&gt; Nevertheless your adversaries are excellent shots, and do damage to the sails and aft. The crew will have to make repairs in the days that follow.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801023</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A traumatic escape.&lt;/b&gt; In the hurry to leave, your ship is spun broadside and exposed to gunfire. There are injuries, but none so deep as the sight of the dead boy's accomplice below. He weeps, and clutches one of the idols - a good luck charm.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801017</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sun is solemn that morning.&lt;/b&gt; The bodies of the dead guards are borne to the hold for burial, but not here, upon this cursed rock. Who killed them none know but the sinister effigies. The expedition fumbles on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801009</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A destructive episode.&lt;/b&gt; No one has information, or perhaps they withhold it. Consensus tends towards the latter. Someone wants this expedition to fail, and these effigies are a threat. Paranoia festers. At the next port, a large part of the crew opts to quit.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801005</GUID><Text>Throw them overboard and move on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801010</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Chilling.&lt;/b&gt; As instructed, the crew collect the dolls and throw them overboard. But relief lasts only until the following morning, when the dolls are found returned, placed exactly as they had been.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802040</GUID><Text>The Mutiny</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802041</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Clear skies, calm seas, and mutiny brewing among your sailors.&lt;/b&gt; The strain of the expedition, the rationing of supplies, the though of danger and the constant, unnerving lack of recognition: it doesn't take much to push the crew over the brink between obedience and its opposite. They unite behind the charisma of their chaplain and drift away from the authority of the first lieutenant.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802042</GUID><Text>Have the lieutenant meet the unofficial leader</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802046</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The two men reach an understanding.&lt;/b&gt; The chaplain's demands are understandable, and the first lieutenant's limits are logical. Both agree on working to reach a better balance of power and supply repartition within the crew, and they leave satisfied with the encounter. A fair outcome for everyone.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802047</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The discussion reaches an end, somehow.&lt;/b&gt; The first mate doesn't listen to the chaplain and the chaplain doesn't hear the first mate. Their to-ing and fro-ing is exasperating even to their own allies. After an endless debate over meaningless details, the two men seem to reach an agreement and shake on it, ending the hostilities. In truth, the established innovations are nothing more than old measures with new faces: novelty, not change.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802048</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There is no trust to be found in the rebel's hearts.&lt;/b&gt; The chaplain refuses to meet your first lieutenant on the deck and invites him to join him in his own quarters instead: in short, in hostile territory.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802049</GUID><Text>Negotiate with the chaplain in his quarters</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802051</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The lieutenant manages to reason with the chaplain.&lt;/b&gt; The officer comes to the ringleaders' quarters unarmed, and stands his ground while surrounded by nothing but hostile faces. He call to the faith of the chaplain and argues for a slow if deep change in the ship's line of command, offering his own position to the chaplain as long as he his kept as a close advisor. His stepping down is discouraging for the loyalists, but it was the only available option at this point.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802052</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The meeting goes nowhere.&lt;/b&gt; With each new compromise offered by the first lieutenant the chaplain adds an additional request, growing more and more assured of his dominance in the current stalemate. The officer leaves with a list of impossible demands and the ringleader's followers stop working altogether. The ship comes to a stop, waiting for a decision to be made.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802054</GUID><Text>Be subtle, send the chaplain poisoned wine</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802057</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A swift and efficient assassination.&lt;/b&gt; Convinced of his advantage in the current situation, the chaplain gracefully accepts the first lieutenant's wine. The poison does not act immediately, but its effect is unequivocal: at dawn, the chaplain is bent over his desk, wide-eyed and grey as dust. No sailor dares to mention the reason for his death. Their caution enforces discipline, fear of their officers, and a general distrust of alcohol.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802058</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The poison is obvious.&lt;/b&gt; The wine reeks, its smell so deadly and its color so murky it might as well have a skull and bones drawn on its label. The chaplain forces the lieutenant's envoy to drink the whole mixture. As the poor girl quivers and coughs blood and bile, the ringleader and his followers leave their quarters - by the time the envoy is dead, they are standing before the first lieutenant's cabin, armed and set on killing.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802059</GUID><Text>In a final attempt at peaceful resolution, offer a bribe</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802061</GUID><Text>This will be costly.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802062</GUID><Text>Okay</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802064</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The bribe is enough, but its price goes beyond monetary value.&lt;/b&gt; The chaplain's despise for the first lieutenant spreads to the crew as they learn of the murder attempt, and the mob of sailors lock their officers in their cabins to stay there until the end of the trip. That they were not killed is the only victory the officers can enjoy.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802063</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802065</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;True anger can only be quelled with bribes of blood.&lt;/b&gt; The chaplain ignores the first lieutenant's plea. The man of faith pulls a rosary from his wrist, gestures for his men to act, and prays. With each bead which passes under his fingers a rebel plants his sword into the lieutenant, and as the officer screams so does the chaplain chants, louder and louder, until the prayer stops. When they leave the cabin, a new and mad order is established on the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802060</GUID><Text>There is no choice but to confront them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802066</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Reinforcements come running at the lieutenant's call.&lt;/b&gt; The chaplain and his followers are surrounded and swiftly defeated, their strength no match for the loyalists' military training and devotion to their officers. Order is reinstated, the loyalists turned into a militia which reigns over the other sailors and suppresses any attempt at questioning the working conditions and power dynamics on the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802067</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The loyalists are less prepared, less convinced, and more brittle.&lt;/b&gt; The rebels break them, destroying what few sailors still tried to uphold discipline on the ship. The chaplain has the survivors attached to the mainmast and forced to drink poison, letting their corpses rot where they stand - a display which warns all sailors against condemning his actions. The trip continues under the rule of the chaplain, with the crew convinced that they just replaced a tyrant with another.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802055</GUID><Text>Be clear, arrest the chaplain for high treason</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802068</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The man of faith is captured and executed.&lt;/b&gt; The loyalists storm the chaplain's quarters and seize him before his followers can react - men used to fight with words can do little in the face of physical oppression. The chaplain is judged on the deck for all to see and hear, accused of high treason, then hanged on the mainmast and left to rot for a week. Fear keeps the sailors in check for the rest of the trip.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802069</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The arrest is a bloodbath.&lt;/b&gt; If the loyalists had had an advantage in discipline or numbers, the arrest could have been quick. However, the whole crew enters the melee, sailors hitting each other blindly, unsure which side they're attacking and which they belong to. The chaplain is dragged across the deck and hanged without trial: a display of gratuitous violence which brings the sailors back to their senses. The body of the man of faith oscillates in the wind, shredded and limp, mirroring the crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802056</GUID><Text>Be ambiguous, ignore the chaplain's demands</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802070</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Inaction is not what the sailors hoped for.&lt;/b&gt; Both loyalists and rebels are dismayed by the absence of decision and restlessness spreads through the crew until the tension finally explodes: the first lieutenant is found dead in his quarters. The defiant act is not punished and most sailors interpret it as yet another sign of weakness, while others argue that the murder was judgment in and of itself.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802053</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The discussion is one-sided and disastrous.&lt;/b&gt; The first lieutenant barges in the chaplain's quarters and belches a series of commands, menacing the ringleader and his men of flogging, hanging, marooning and flogging again. The loyalists feel ashamed of following such a disrespectful idiot. Under the cover of the night, when the chaplain and his followers steal a long boat to desert the unbearable rule of the officers, many sailors follow. Less than half of the original crew remains.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802050</GUID><Text>That's enough disobedience, arrest the chaplain</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802071</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The loyalists' strength dwindles when facing friends.&lt;/b&gt; Loyalists and troublemakers collide in a short and feeble brawl, each side unable to give up or to kill their former crewmates. Shots willingly miss, slashes willingly fumble, punches willingly go limp. The fight goes out without a clear victor, and the rest of the trip is spent with both side wary of each other.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802072</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The loyalists are too weak.&lt;/b&gt; The conflict erupts into an exchange of slurs, then blows, then gunshots. Men and women frantically try to kill sailors who were good friends and both first lieutenant and chaplain are no exceptions: the ring leader unexpectedly draw a sword and both men impale each other, their deaths signaling the end of the senseless fight. The crew collects its thoughts to mourn the man of Church for the efforts he put in for them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802043</GUID><Text>Offer a rise to the chaplain</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802073</GUID><Text>The chaplain looks expectantly.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802074</GUID><Text>Okay</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802076</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A pragmatic solution.&lt;/b&gt; The amount offered to the chaplain to buy his obedience is enough for the man of faith to ignore the incongruity of the monetary negotiations. With the roots of their problem still present the crew remains unruly, but the bought leader makes sure to maintain their anger at the lowest levels.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802075</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802077</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The offer does not match the chaplain's expectations.&lt;/b&gt; If his calmness is to be bought, the price should be enough for him to share with all the sailors he roused. The offended man of faith retreats to his quarters without a word.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802044</GUID><Text>Make an example out of the ring leader</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802078</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The budding mutiny is easily crushed.&lt;/b&gt; The first lieutenant and two loyalists are all it takes to seize the chaplain and drag him to judgement: the man is condemned to be marooned on the next deserted island they find, and left to die at will or live in solitude. The swift arrest and punishment impresses the rest of the crew and renews their respect for their officers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802079</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The loyalists' strength dwindles when facing friends.&lt;/b&gt; Loyalists and troublemakers collide in a short and feeble brawl, each side unable to give up or to kill their former crewmates.

Men and women frantically try to kill sailors who were good friends and both first lieutenant and chaplain are no exceptions: the man of faith unexpectedly draws a sword and both men impale each other, their deaths signaling the end of the senseless fight.

As they push the village's rundown barricade, they happen upon a group of warriors who immediately assume a defensive formation in a motion almost too perfect to be human. There's not a single man among them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802205</GUID><Text>Let a woman do the talking</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802208</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The warriors greatly enjoy your specialist's company.&lt;/b&gt; Glad to see a fellow woman act as a presence of power, the fighters invite your crew to share the bounty of their raiding: despite the difference in tongue and civilization, your sailors enjoy a feast of exotic game and liquor and spend the night improvising songs and dances with the women.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802206</GUID><Text>Present your peaceful intentions</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802209</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat dispels the barrier of language.&lt;/b&gt; Mimicking the sailors' trip through the seas and showing the women their ship, maps and supplies, the diplomat manages to have them understand the goals of your crew. The warriors eagerly observe your charts and point out what areas your ship should investigate next - their excitement suggesting their own love of discovery. Crew and women part with the conviction of having met like-minded explorers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802210</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Groveling is not respect.&lt;/b&gt; Your diplomat treats the women like savages, kneeling before them and uttering oooh and aaah sounds which are seen as insulting even by the crew. One of the female warriors steps forward and plants a lance in his thigh.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802211</GUID><Text>Respond to their violence in kind</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802213</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your guns provide an underhanded upper hand.&lt;/b&gt; While the warriors fight with lances and short war hammers, your sailors draw their pistols and fire them at will. The women draw back, dragging their wounded and dead away, while your crew savor the bitter victory. How would they have fared without the guns?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802214</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Small arms, huge defeat.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors fire their pistols at the women in a clumsy and disorganized manner, which cannot hold against the warriors' discipline and flawless coordination. Walking on the corpses of their own kin, the women pierce through your ranks and slaughter them. They spare what few explorers were women and let them run back to the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802212</GUID><Text>Appease them with gifts</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802215</GUID><Text>The women look interested but cautious.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802216</GUID><Text>Confirm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802218</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The exotic supplies intrigue the warriors.&lt;/b&gt; Curiosity replaces their anger and seeing how fascinated they are by the crew's maps, the sailors guess that the women might share their taste for exploration. Sadly, it is too late to earn the warriors' trust and they leave with your presents in silence.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802217</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802219</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A waste of time.&lt;/b&gt; The warriors barely have the time to examine your supplies that an officer barks an order to pull the crates back into the ship, leaving the women baffled and offended. The officer heads flies and the warriors cleave through your sailors until they reach your cargo. They leave with a tall barrel of liquor and disappear from the scene of carnage.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802207</GUID><Text>Bow before the goddesses</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802220</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew's deference pleases the warriors.&lt;/b&gt; Surprised by the sailors bowing before them in respect, the women giggle and lower their guard. They tap the explorers' chins with the tip of their lances, inviting them to drop their hunching position for a proper face-to-face. Although they do not share a language, they manage to communicate through their love of meat and drink, and the feast lasts deep into the night.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802221</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Can these men show real respect?&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors cannot translate their admiration in their acts. They crawl to the women and hold their hands, letting their sweat soil the soft skin and their eyes trail the soft shapes. One of the warrior spits to their face in disgust. The other women imitate her and walk away, whispering among themselves.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802222</GUID><Text>Wash this offense in blood</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802224</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The assault is one-sided.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors draw their guns and shoot the warriors in their backs, taking down the women with ease and ganging up against the remaining ones. Reassured of their fortitude, the men leave the settlement and try to ignore the debasing aspect of this unnecessary bloodshed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802225</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Skill, conviction, discipline: your men lack them all.&lt;/b&gt; They draw their guns and fire at the women, who react at once and pounce on their assailants. Short war hammers appear in their hands and end up in skulls. One hit, one kill. Terrified by the warriors' martial ability, the survivors abandon the fight and run back to the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802223</GUID><Text>Ignore the humiliation and let them leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802226</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors feel humiliated.&lt;/b&gt; They let the warriors leave and console themselves as they can by looting the remains of the settlement, but the women have left no stone unturned. Empty-handed and disgraced, they go back to the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802672</GUID><Text>The Runaway</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802673</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The local authorities are looking for the refugee you have taken in.&lt;/b&gt; A man in rags offers you his services in a harbour, arguing that he'd do any odd job for food and a chance at joining your crew. Unlike other temporary hires, he grows onto your sailors, filling in wherever there is work, catching onto the ship's spirit and disputing debates over the expedition's course. His skills testify to a life beyond that of a common sailor, but your crew respects his secrecy. As your ship leaves the harbour, a patrolling warship stops it: they are looking for a political dissident and the description matches your new recruit.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802675</GUID><Text>"We have never seen him."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802679</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew presents a coherent lie.&lt;/b&gt; Have anyone anywhere seen anybody? They inspect the picture of the runaway, speculate on hiding places, rummage through the cargo while the refugee buries under the supplies, unseen. The pretence of dedication convinces the authorities, who leave after a warm acknowledgement of their efforts. When the harbour is out of sight, the runaway emerges with a grin worth all thanks. A new recruit for your expedition!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802680</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew's deceit is silly at best.&lt;/b&gt; The lieutenants argue that they just arrived into port and couldn't possibly have had any contact with the population yet, but the warship obviously saw your vessel dock at the harbour. Their suspicions roused, they ask you to lower a footbridge for an inspection of the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802681</GUID><Text>Hide the man and allow them onboard</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802683</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No better places to hide than the ones you know by heart.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors stash the fugitive into the belly of the ship, a bundle of rags buried between crates of supplies and sacks of food. A perfect camouflage. The patrolling guards soon abandon their inspection and let your ship leave after taking note of its name. To avoid future inspections, the runaway chooses to leave at the next island.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802684</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The fugitive is more lost than the guards.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors shove him in the lower deck and urge him to hide without any form of guidance or advice. When the patrol guards descend into the ship, they find the runaway rummaging through the crates, still looking for a place to hide. They immediately seize him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802685</GUID><Text>Enough complying already - threaten them to leave or else!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802687</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your threat works despite the situation.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors surround the guards in silence, stepping between them and the runaway, forcing the intruders to the upper deck and off the ship. Your vessel leaves before they can call reinforcements and the fugitive is dropped at the first harbour, for fear of retaliation. The separation is hurried and leaves a sour aftertaste. At least, with luck, he'll be safe.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802688</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's no threatening these men.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors try to step between them and the runaway, but the lump of scrawny arms and pouting faces is far from intimidating. They are shoved away and what few sailors try to resist are hauled along with the fugitive and taken to suffer his fate: death by hanging.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802686</GUID><Text>Enough errors already - let them take the man</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802689</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew offers little resistance.&lt;/b&gt; They part before the patrol as it advances to seize the runaway. The dissident starts to thank the sailors for their efforts, but a slap shuts him up and he is collared before being dragged away. Your crew never managed to create the safe haven he deserved. They watch the warship disappear along the coast, trying to refrain from imagining the fate of their friend.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802682</GUID><Text>Threaten to fire your cannons at their ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802690</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your firepower is impressive indeed.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors line all hatches with cannons and light their fuses in the same movement, aiming the dark mouths at the patrolling warship. The patrol captain hurriedly orders his own crew to hurtle away from the crazy fools. The cannonade salutes their departure. The fugitive is extremely thankful and leave your crew at the next island with a warm goodbye.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802691</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An empty threat.&lt;/b&gt; Lying about your itinerary was more credible than pretending your ship can muster any form of naval power. Eyeing your sailors as they struggle to deploy and load the cannons, the patrol captain orders his men to get ready to board your ship. Your crew is suspicious enough for him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802692</GUID><Text>They don't board you. You board them!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802694</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The assault is abrupt and wicked.&lt;/b&gt; For an agonizing moment of hesitation none seems to prevail, until your sailors manage to get the upper hand and slaughter the warship's crew. Your vessel flees the harbour and drops the fugitive at the next safe island, aware they have made enemies out of legal authorities for the sake of one good man.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802695</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The fight is routine for your opponents.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew boards the warship with nothing more than their confidence, and their sluggish skills crash against the overwhelming discipline of the patrol guards. The runaway stands up to help your sailors, screaming to get the guards' attention, and is instantly shot. His death marks the end of the fight. Your ship is exiled before the crew can mourn their dead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802693</GUID><Text>Let them board the ship and take the man</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802676</GUID><Text>"Is it a fight you are looking for?"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802696</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The patrol cowers away from your ship.&lt;/b&gt; Of course they are not looking for a fight, not with a vessel looking as overpowered as yours! It might have been their swift deployment of cannons or the absolute stoicism with which your sailors warned the patrol - either way, your presence and menace is overwhelming. Your ship is free to leave the harbour, its new recruit already toasting to his freedom and the crew gladly following him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802697</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The patrol is not impressed by your ship's armament.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew flings slurs at the inspection warship and scatters through the ship, deploying unsteady cannons, bumping against closed hatches and very audibly cursing their lack of ammunitions. Trying to refrain his laughter as his own crew deploys brand new ordnance rifles, the patrol captain asks your sailors to demonstrate how they intend to overpower him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802698</GUID><Text>Demonstrate</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802700</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It takes one accurate shot to demonstrate power.&lt;/b&gt; Giving up on shooting all cannons, your sailors focus on firing the single best shot of their lives. The cannonball flies past the warship's railings and crushes their mainmast, sending wood and metal to rain on the patrol guards and giving your ship the window of time necessary to flee. The fugitive leaves your crew at the next island, grateful but unwilling to aggravate your feud with the local authorities.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802701</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Poor decision.&lt;/b&gt; Following their display of clumsy preparation, your sailors try to attack using the artillery they were insulting a second before. The cannons rear under their mishandling and fire at the ship itself, piercing hole after hole in the hull and hurling sailors into the sea. The patrol faces no resistance when they come onboard, pluck the fugitive, and leave the devastated vessel.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802699</GUID><Text>Surrender</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802702</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew offers little resistance.&lt;/b&gt; They part before the patrol as it advances to seize the runaway. The dissident starts to thank the sailors for their efforts, but a slap shuts him up and he is collared before being dragged away. Your crew never managed to create the safe haven he deserved. They watch the warship disappear along the coast, trying to refrain from imagining the fate of their friend.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802677</GUID><Text>"You have never seen us."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802703</GUID><Text>The fugitive holds his breath as you prepare the bribe.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802704</GUID><Text>Confirm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802706</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A smooth operation.&lt;/b&gt; The patrol pockets your goods with twisted smiles, your payment surpassing the rewards promised for the capture of the runaway. As they clear the way and your ship passes by them, your new recruit waves to the guards and curtsies before wishing them a great day. Yes, your crew is going to like him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802705</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802707</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your offer is far from enough.&lt;/b&gt; The patrolling guards must have been promised a great reward for the capture of the fugitive. Taking your attempt as an effort to bribe them and highly suspicious behaviour, they lower footbridges and open cannon hatches, ready to board your ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802678</GUID><Text>"Here is the man you are looking for."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802708</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors hand over the runaway.&lt;/b&gt; The refugee is dejected but keeps his emotions in check, letting the patrolling guards chain him while looking straight at your crew. His look is avoided. The patrol rewards the sailors with bags of supplies, a miserable trade for the life of a good man and the shame of your crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800279</GUID><Text>The Predator</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800280</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'A fearsome predator stalks us!'&lt;/b&gt; the cabin-boy whispers. Perhaps he is right, for this resupply has not been as uneventful as hoped. Only the first evening moored in this bay, and a man goes missing - tracks up the beach into jungle. Many wonder how work can be expected to continue...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800281</GUID><Text>Bait the creature</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800286</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;With the perfect lure&lt;/b&gt; placed enticingly in the crook of a tree, there is an inevitability about a capture. Sure enough, yellow eyes pierce the darkness, and a mighty beast pads softly over to the bait. A net is hurriedly cast about it and secured, thus leaving the expedition free to resupply unthreatened.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800282</GUID><Text>Send hunters to track it</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800287</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your huntmasters are expert,&lt;/b&gt; and trace with great care, the soft hollows imprinted by feline paw. Led to a clearing, they correctly judge this to be a lair, where they stand ready with a net. When the cat returns, heaving hot breath, the hunters pounce. With net secure, the expedition is free to resupply unthreatened.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800288</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;At least one hunter did the right thing,&lt;/b&gt; and kept his eyes open while they traced the beast's pawprints. Another was not so wise, and was heard to let out a scream. His comrades were drawn to the spot, and struck the majestic beast down. But not before the damage was done.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800289</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Three days pass, and still no word.&lt;/b&gt; There is a common feeling something must be done to save those men.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800290</GUID><Text>Send a rescue party</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800293</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is only something of a relief&lt;/b&gt; when the rescue party return. It's bad news... the hunters are dead. The rescue party described the bright and long-maned beast, and how in a tussle, they slayed it. With the bodies of the hunters buried, the expedition is able to resupply in an atmosphere of respectful silence.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800294</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Horror! It's picking us off one by one!'&lt;/b&gt; bawls a fearful sailor, for now the rescue party too, have failed to return. There is nothing for the disconsolate remainder of the crew to do, but leave this sorry place behind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800291</GUID><Text>Wait a bit longer</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800295</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Doubtful prayer brings no news&lt;/b&gt; of the lost hunters. The men have nowhere to look for guidance, and there is a burdensome feeling that a decision must be made.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800296</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Conviction in the lord is of little use here,&lt;/b&gt; it seems. Two days later a hunter, whose leg is mangled, limps back into view. After the necessary amputation, he is heard to groan that the others perished. All must leave this savage place.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800292</GUID><Text>Leave the island without them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800297</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'We leave them for dead,&lt;/b&gt; when they could be right there now waiting for us!' cries a furious old tar. Like so many others, he is disgusted that good men should give their lives for nothing but impatience!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800283</GUID><Text>Speak with locals</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800298</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Absurd magic, but it works!'&lt;/b&gt; say officers sent to the inland village for help. Having described the beast, they were referred to a witch. She encouraged them to ingest live scorpions, one of each colour; yellow, red and black. This they did reluctantly, but found when they confronted the animal, it took flight. All promptly follow the witch's advice, and sure enough, remain undisturbed for the remainder of the resupply.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800299</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Our plight means nothing to the locals,'&lt;/b&gt; bemoan the officers sent as diplomats. 'Telling them beasts stalk the jungle, is as like alerting a hatter to the presence of hats on his hatstands.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800300</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Their deity is desecrated!'&lt;/b&gt; urges the officer sent as diplomat. All around the bay, daubed faces appear, bows raised to the expedition camp.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800301</GUID><Text>Teach them a lesson</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800303</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'A hollow victory',&lt;/b&gt; say the men. For the locals lie dead, but the jungle beast stalks on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800304</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Odds against them, the men fight as best they can.&lt;/b&gt; Fought back onto the sand, they deflect the rain of arrows with whatever they can lay hands on. A relay is able to return precious equipment to the ship and set sail, but not without a number of casualties, of whom some do not make it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800305</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The onslaught is deadly.&lt;/b&gt; Few among your crew have the requisite experience to defend themselves, and so the sand reddens with their blood. Of those who make it as far as the expedition ship, a number succumb to the poison-tip arrows. It is a massacre.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800302</GUID><Text>Run for the ship!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800306</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Run!' comes the panicked cry.&lt;/b&gt; The men drop their work, and tramp desperately through the shallows to the ship. A volley of arrows pierces three, squirting crimson into the clear blue. 'Dead aside, we have lost a great deal more in provisions than we have gained,' laments the quartermaster, as your ship departs that wretched bay.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800284</GUID><Text>Lay a trap</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800307</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ingenious powers&lt;/b&gt; of the craftsmen among your crew have fashioned a pitfall for the beast. There is not long to wait before there is a tinkle on the handbell, and all can gather above the trap to see the monster growling at its bottom. The resupply may now happily proceed, knowing that danger is averted.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800308</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The beast is too intelligent&lt;/b&gt; to fall for makeshift traps. It is clearly evading the pitfall prepared by those supposed to be the expedition's deftest craftsmen. 'Little more we can do,' they shrug.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800285</GUID><Text>Leave the island</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800309</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'It's a considerable setback,'&lt;/b&gt; say senior officers. Fresh water, wood for burning, plants for medicine - it does no good to list what myriad opportunities are missed in bypassing the bay. And all for the sake of fears over one measly wild animal.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800605</GUID><Text>A Grizzly Encounter</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800606</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Bear attack!&lt;/b&gt; The party ponder this very real possibility as threatening grunts stop them dead among the firs. Fifty yards ahead, a huge specimen lurches up on two legs like a totem, standing between them and escape. More grunting echoes nearby. The party stay silent, awaiting guidance.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800607</GUID><Text>Scare the bears away</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800611</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Boooooom!&lt;/b&gt; The valley shudders with the sweet stench of exploded dynamite. The bears hurry away, leaving the crew thoroughly entertained at the superiority of mankind and the power of invention.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800608</GUID><Text>Use hunting knowledge to get the better of the bears</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800612</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Trust in the expert hunters never feels misplaced&lt;/b&gt;, even when they recommend the party break into passionate song. For singing the shanty 'Cheerly-ay-oh' brings the crew together, whilst also dispersing the wary bears deep into the forest.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800613</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hunters lack guile.&lt;/b&gt; They have enough to lead the crew on a route silent as a church, but not enough to stop a bear sniffing them out. It's easy to believe from its vacant eyes, that it sees you as a potentially delicious kind of threat.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800615</GUID><Text>Attack the bear</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800617</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The bear's face proves a good target.&lt;/b&gt; Ducking the terrifying whooshes of its paws, someone manages to prime their pistol and shoot it through the eye. The bear drops dead. No-one feels particularly good about killing it, but the way ahead is now clear.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800618</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Adaptation is good when a fight isn't going well.&lt;/b&gt; The bear flinches but does not drop after the first round of gunfire. There is no time to reload, before it is upon them with its paws. Knocked down the men are smart enough to play dead. After an hour or so facing the floor, the bears lose interest and leave. The crew are able to lick their wounds, and move on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800619</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's easy to underestimate mummy bears.&lt;/b&gt; As the soldiers fluff the loading of their weapons, the bear nonchalantly grasps one by the wrist, and sinks her jaw into his neck. The others panic and flee with their arms in the air. She pursues a second, striking him dead against a rock. Now she and her cubs can finally be left in peace.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800616</GUID><Text>Outmanoeuvre the bear</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800620</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes it helps to know your hill contours.&lt;/b&gt; The crew carefully fall away, circumventing the bear's position, and keeping their backs to the mountainside. With the higher ground, the bear appears to lose interest. Hearts pumping, the crew hurry to safety.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800621</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Stupidly the crew decide to run, and reach a dead-end.&lt;/b&gt; The bear pursues at a leisurely speed, yet with no less menace, and the crew are forced to seek refuge in a cave, or else try climbing the trees.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800623</GUID><Text>Hide in the cave and pray</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800625</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Against all anxiety, the Bear doesn't follow.&lt;/b&gt; Still, the men in the cave are too afraid to light a fire, or sleep through the night. Shattered and hungry, they emerge the next morning, only to find their sacrifice was wholly unnecessary.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800626</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Bears can see terribly well in the dark&lt;/b&gt;, and since your crew have stumbled into its house, where its vulnerable infants sleep, it is not very happy. The crew that do manage to break for daylight have clothes ragged and torn, and cannot speak, for it is clear they were the lucky ones.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800624</GUID><Text>Climb the trees</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800627</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew climb the trees well enough&lt;/b&gt;, but the bear isn't going to make their lives easy. It is a full day and night before it gives up shaking trunks, or climbing halfway up towards the dangling crew. When it finally leaves, the exhausted crew descend, their nerves in shreds.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800628</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Bears are awfully good at climbing trees&lt;/b&gt;, and as on this occasion, it is not uncommon to see them strike their adversaries from the branches. Its hapless victim plunges from the canopy and lands like a sack of red berries on rocks below. Others injure themselves as the men drop from the trees in a desperate escape.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800614</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Call themselves hunters!&lt;/b&gt; The tracks thought to lead away from bear territory go instead to a clearing at its heart. The bears at first seem alarmed their picnic is disturbed, until they realise your crew are on the menu. The sound of crunching bone rings in the ears of the few that manage to flee.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800609</GUID><Text>Attack the bear blocking the way</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800629</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The lone bear's haunch is picked out with expert marksmanship.&lt;/b&gt; It staggers before bounding off into the woods. Your crew are delighted to return to the safety of the ship, whilst also having done the mighty beast no lasting harm.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800630</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The first volley of shots miss&lt;/b&gt;, and the bear attacks. A second shot finds its mark, and the wounded bear escapes into the trees, but a man lies dead. His brother cries revenge, and is already off into the woods to hunt the grisly killer.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800632</GUID><Text>Track the wounded bear with him</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800634</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Bittersweet.&lt;/b&gt; Your fine tracking skills allow the crew to catch up with the bear and watch it from hiding. It is a she-bear, and is now nuzzling its young cubs. 'That is why she killed him,' says the brother, gone all vitriol. 'Let us leave, and hope my brother's spirit may somehow live on in this place.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800635</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hot-headed hunt is a success none celebrate.&lt;/b&gt; Once found, the bear no longer has strength to defend itself. As the brother drives a stake into its heart, it gives over with a last sad sigh. In that moment a tiny cub pads into the open, crawling weakly under the limp arm of its mother. If only they had understood, the crew could have saved the heartache.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800636</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Hunting is impossible with passions running this high.&lt;/b&gt; When another man snaps a twig, the vengeful brother attacks him wildly, and the others fail to intervene. The brother's eyes glaze as he slides to the earth, bayonet in his back.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800633</GUID><Text>Leave the fool behind</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800637</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The decision is unpopular.&lt;/b&gt; 'Stubborn 'til the end,' say those in the minority. But the greater part have things to say on the subject of dishonour. 'Those brothers loved each other to the end,' remarks one old sailor, 'and what little love did we show for them...'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800631</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Out here, bears rule.&lt;/b&gt; The wildly inaccurate gunfire  serves only to rile the bear into a frenzy, and draw attention to your position. Then a second, larger bear thunders from the undergrowth and mauls a man to death. A few of your piffling soldiery manage to escape with all their limbs attached.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800610</GUID><Text>Use Camouflage</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800638</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The bears have no chance.&lt;/b&gt; Indeed, the camouflage is so good, the crew can barely see one another! Thickly daubed in the colours of the forest, the chameleon crew bypass the bears with ease. A story of ingenuity at which their grandchildren shall marvel!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800639</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Even the most hardened sailors find the smell unbearable.&lt;/b&gt; Not to mention the indignity of covering oneself in bear excrement for longer than is perfectly necessary. Eventually though the bears depart, leaving the reeking crew free to have a much-needed wash.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800640</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Dressing as pantomime trees is a bad idea&lt;/b&gt;, and as the bears attack, the flimsy branches the crew intended to cover their faces prove no more effective in self-defence. The ensuing scene might have made for an impressive spectacle on the stage, though only as the most gruesome of tragedies.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802299</GUID><Text>Release the Kraken</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802300</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A kraken!&lt;/b&gt; The rainstorm parts to reveal tentacles wide as a barrel and long as ten men, snaking between the waves. The creature of legends is heading towards the ship at full speed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802301</GUID><Text>Fire a torpedo at the beast</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802304</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The so-called beast is no match for a torpedo.&lt;/b&gt; Firing a torpedo is a first for most of your crew, yet they manage to handle the unusual weaponry with skill. The self-propelled projectile flies underwater and crashes into the kraken with an explosion that shakes the storm itself. One more tale to tell back home!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802305</GUID><Text>Kill the monster</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802306</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;If harpoons can kill whales, they can kill monsters.&lt;/b&gt; Despite the pounding rain and poor visibility, the sailors manage to load a harpoon and fire it at the kraken: the beast shakes, flails, and disappears into the sea under the triumphant cheers of the crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802307</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Panicked men try to shoot at the monster.&lt;/b&gt; The bullets drop into the water like meaningless pebbles and do no harm to the kraken except rouse its anger. Flailing its tentacles, the creature hits the ship with full force and soon ensnares the boat.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802308</GUID><Text>Try to cut the tentacles</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802309</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The gigantic tentacles are sawed off.&lt;/b&gt; Using the engineers' oversized ship saw, the sailors manage to cut through the elastic flesh of the monster. The kraken convulses and lets go of ship, leaving the crew to repair the boat and wipe out what gooey blood was spilled on the deck.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802310</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Measly men make no miracles.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors assault the tentacles, trying to plant what swords and knives and forks they have at hand into the thick flesh. The suckers stay glued to the deck. The beast shakes and its suckers tremble, extending for a tense second before bouncing back up, taking large parts of the deck with them. Wood and metal rain over the sailors and the kraken leaves them to die.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802311</GUID><Text>Try to bombard the kraken</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802312</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The creature matches your strength for a short while.&lt;/b&gt; It grabs the ship and rocks it, shaking several cannons away from their sailors. The remaining artillery is fired without delay and strikes the kraken into submission, sending it back to the depths it came from. The sailors have but light repairs to perform on the cannons.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802313</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The power of the beast largely surpasses yours.&lt;/b&gt; A glassy eye levels with the deck, reflecting the sailors's silhouettes as they make hurried preparations to shoot the cannons. The cannonballs fly by the kraken and leave it unscathed, allowing it to grapple and tip over the ship with its unsheathed hooks, pouring sailors into its beak. It then disappears from your crew's sight, but not their nightmares.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802315</GUID><Text>Outrun the thing</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802316</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Full steam ahead!&lt;/b&gt; Using the full power of your steam ship, the vessel leaps and tears through the waves, leaving the kraken to swirl in its wake. A sailor blows the ship's horn to salute the creature and watches in delight as it plunges back into the ocean.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802317</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The wind is ideal for such a maneuver.&lt;/b&gt; Your navigators and sailors rush to their posts and work to align ship and storm, fusing the vessel with the elements. The wind carries the ship away from the kraken, and delivers it to a sunny clearing of calm and monsterless waters.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802318</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew cannot outmaneuver the storm.&lt;/b&gt; They wrestle the wind and rain, their struggle showing in the chaotic movements of the ship. The kraken slips under the vessel and emerges in front of it, stopping any escape attempt by ensnaring the prow in its tentacles.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802320</GUID><Text>Teeth of the Mountain</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802321</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;These tracks could belong to maneaters.&lt;/b&gt; The crew's reconnaissance report carried intriguing rumours of local threats: abducted men and women, quarries filled with human bones, and a mountain chain too impenetrable to be devoid of valuable finds. Almost as soon as your explorers start their ascension, they spot fresh tracks in the dry leaves.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802322</GUID><Text>Follow the tracks</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802323</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors follow the tracks without trouble.&lt;/b&gt; The trail of footprints runs among the mountain's trees, zigzaging among dead leaves and fallen trunks, disappearing under the steps of your explorers. It leads the sailors deep into the forest, to a clearing where a tiny village is nested. Under the tiled roofs of their Old World homes, the inhabitants are white-skinned and blue-eyed. If they are cannibals, they don't look the part.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802324</GUID><Text>Engage a friendly conversation with the inhabitants</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802325</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat realizes that the autochthons speak a similar language.&lt;/b&gt; The blue-eyed inhabitants answer in a patois laced with foreign expressions and sounds, but there is no mistaking the origins of their dialect. Pleased by the diplomat's banter, they invite your crew to share a feast of exotic meats and vegetables, and describe the grand adventures of their ancestors to your fascinated crew: tales of exiled war prisoners and their fight to create a new home.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802326</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The diplomat mistakes civilized aspect for civilized behaviour.&lt;/b&gt; She strides straight into the village, confident in the autochthons' pacifism, and spreads her arms to the nearest woman - a young girl who shrieks upon seeing her and bites the welcoming hand. The alerted villagers surround your diplomat with pitchforks and shovels. They creep on her, poking her with their improvised weapons.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802327</GUID><Text>Face the villagers to rescue your diplomat</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802328</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew manages to rescue her.&lt;/b&gt; Taking advantage of the villagers' obsession with the intruder, the sailors surround them and attack as one in a flurry of gunshots and slicing swords. Visibly terrified by the pistols and unable to face the military unison of your crew, the autochthons flee and leave the diplomat to be rescued. Wether the encounter could have been solved peacefully, you will never know.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802329</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew is overwhelmed.&lt;/b&gt; They attempt a clumsy charge, overlooking any assessment of the enemy's strength, and crash against the wall of peasants' weapons. They disband as fast as they engaged the fight and become easy targets for the villagers, who gleefully hunt them and cheer each time a sailor is struck down. The rare survivors are left to ponder what grim fate awaits those who were captured.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802331</GUID><Text>Run away without her</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802332</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Run, run away!&lt;/b&gt; Leaving your diplomat to face the villagers alone, the crew flees back to the ship. As they bury into the forest they hear a sudden and hideous scream, which ends as brutally as it erupted. No sailor comment on the voice: they all recognized the diplomat.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802333</GUID><Text>Survey the village's activity from a distance</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802334</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew is undetected and detects nothing of interest.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors conceal themselves among the trees and observe the villagers from a distance, too far from their activities to understand the reasons for the inhabitants' busy bustle. They return to the ship without proof nor denial of the rumoured cannibalism.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802336</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You call that discreet?&lt;/b&gt; The sailors tiptoe around the village, stopping every few feet to comment on which branch they should or shouldn't step on, so focused on their feet they do not even consider how the wind carries their sounds and smells. When they finally raise their heads, an army of pitchforks welcomes them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802337</GUID><Text>Apologise to the villagers for trespassing</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802338</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat manages to be understood.&lt;/b&gt; She mumbles a variety of foreign words until the villagers, touched by her efforts, respond. Their language is intelligible, if made of outdated expressions: a testimony to their ancestors, they say, war prisoners sent to die here generations ago. They leave little doubt regarding which country sent them. Your sailors are ushered away before they can inquire about the villagers' past or their dietary habits.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802339</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Rather than apologise, your diplomat crawls.&lt;/b&gt; She tugs at the villagers' sleeves and shows how unarmed she is, advising your sailors to drop their own weapons in order to display their benevolence. Rather than restraint, the villagers see submission. They take the weaponry and let the sailors escape in exchange for the diplomat - the last your crew sees of her is her figure tied to a towering pole, for a purpose best left unknown.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802340</GUID><Text>Strike first!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802341</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Where discretion fails, force prevails.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew is unfazed by the villagers and springs to action: its sudden and precise attack knocks them down and their resistance drowns under the repeated assaults of the sailors. Your explorers step over the corpses and explore the now deserted village, where they find strings of human bones attached between houses and clicking in the breeze. They have eradicated a terrible menace!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802342</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors are trampled.&lt;/b&gt; Their meager military training barely resists in the face of the assault. The crew dissolves and flees into the forest. To their horror, human-sized snares lie on the ground, all metal teeth and blade tongues, and they bite and hook legs in a terribly perfect choreography. This forest was made to hunt humans. About half of the sailors makes it back to the ship, the others fallen prey to the maneating mountain.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802343</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The path escapes the explorers, who find themselves surrounded.&lt;/b&gt; The crew's untrained eyes cannot catch the details which indicate that the danger does not lie ahead, but behind them. When they finally sense the hostile presence, they turn to discover a vision way below their expectations: instead of savages with pierced skin and belts of human bones, they discover white men and women, their eyes blue and their clothes very civilized.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802344</GUID><Text>Avoid the tracks</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802347</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Avoiding the tracks apparently means getting as lost as possible.&lt;/b&gt; Taking care not to cross the path of whoever laid these footprints, the sailors avoid all semblances of roads and bury themselves deep into the mountain's forest. They emerge after three days of aimless wandering, devoured not by the rumoured cannibals but by mosquitoes, ticks and leeches.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802348</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Avoiding the tracks apparently means getting as lost as possible.&lt;/b&gt; Taking care not to cross the path of whoever laid these footprints, the sailors avoid all semblances of roads and bury themselves deep into the mountain's forest. They emerge after three days of aimless wandering, devoured not by the rumoured cannibals but by mosquitoes, ticks and leeches.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802351</GUID><Text>The Mayan Map</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802352</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Chipped paint and golden ink: this map might lead you to El Dorado.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors eagerly whisper and envision new fortunes, seeing the map as the most bona fide lead they've ever had on the glorious golden city. The map is not a rare item: several expedition team have owned and followed it, but all campaigns ended in disaster. Will your crew be the one to prevail against the Mayan map's challenges?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802353</GUID><Text>Hire a guide to navigate the jungle</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802354</GUID><Text>The guide waits for an offer.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802355</GUID><Text>Confirm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802356</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The guide is used to following the Mayan map.&lt;/b&gt; She leads the crew through a path she knows by heart, and your sailors cannot help but wonder about the fate of the previous explorers. Dead, the guide says. She halts as the group comes near a waterfall, its center parted by a carved crag and opening on a cave filled with the echo of dripping water. The map insists you should go inside, but the guide refuses to go any further: death awaits beyond this threshold.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802357</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802358</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew is on its own.&lt;/b&gt; The guide scoffs at their refusal to pay her price, and wishes them good luck, teasing them about dangers as numerous as they are implausible. The sailors tense up.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802359</GUID><Text>Follow the map without help</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802361</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors follow the Mayan map through the jungle maze.&lt;/b&gt; Tracks of the numerous explorers who came before them render the terrain illegible, but your crew is seasoned in the art of tracking and manage to find what little clues were left intact after the passage of the previous adventurers. Here two intertwined trees match the map. There a majestic waterfall. As they approach the later, they see its waters are parted by a large carved stone: underneath it is the gaping mouth of a cave.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802362</GUID><Text>Interpret the carvings on the stone</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802363</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The true treasure map is carved into the stone!&lt;/b&gt; Your anthropologist examines the engraved crag which marks the tunnel's entrance, and understands the passage is a decoy. He combines the Mayan map with the carvings' scattered indications and leads your explorers to the pond at the feet of the waterfall. The sailors dive, bringing back piece after piece of mossy coral, which reveal artifacts when opened. A clever find!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802364</GUID><Text>Examine the cave for secret passages</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802365</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A passage!&lt;/b&gt; The crew scrutinizes the cave's walls and are not fooled by the water flowing along them. They push through the liquid curtain and feel no ground behind it - the veil of water hides an exit. They emerge soaked, a cold breeze sticking their clothes to their skin. The wind comes from several tunnels ahead. The Mayan map indicates the correct road, but the tunnel itself states otherwise: it is collapsed and full of debris.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802366</GUID><Text>Build a scaffold to clear the rubble of the right path</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802367</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The path is secured and the reward is worth the effort.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors with carpenter skills erect makeshift scaffolding along the sides of the blocked tunnel, progressing inch by inch as the others clear the rubble below. As they push yet another boulder, it falls forward and lets a ray of golden light pierce through. Is this El Dorado? The pyramidal cave beyond doesn't look like a city, but it is indeed filled with precious artifacts.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802368</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The architectural exercise is more than your crew can handle.&lt;/b&gt; They try to clear the rubble while supporting the tunnel's ceiling with what logs and rocks they can find, but with each new consolidation come new pieces on the brink of falling. As they push yet another boulder, it falls forward and the whole structure follows, collapsing onto itself and burying the road to El Dorado for good.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802369</GUID><Text>Find a way through the other tunnels</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802370</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew triumphs of the labyrinth.&lt;/b&gt; Following the cryptic indications of the Mayan map, they navigate through the damp tunnels and their intricate structure, taking care to mark their path onto the map for the travel back. They emerge into a cave shaped like an inverted pyramid, its center adorned with centuries-old frescoes and clay pots protecting ancient offerings. The effort was worth it!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802371</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Going forward is easy, going back never is.&lt;/b&gt; Unsure whether navigating the alternative tunnels is a good idea, the crew sends groups of two into the passageways. Devoid of the Mayan map and unable to orient themselves in the underground labyrinth, the sailors get lost in its unfathomable depths. Those who make it back are devoured by claustrophobia while those who found treasures pay it with their eternal imprisonment.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802372</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They find nothing.&lt;/b&gt; The cave is a beautiful place, its walls covered in steady streams which catch the sunlight and its air saturated with the fresh smell of moss, but no other treasures than memories can be discovered here. The crew departs, aware that the Mayan map promised much more than what they found.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802373</GUID><Text>Enter the cave and pray for guidance</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802374</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Their praying guide the explorers through the darkness.&lt;/b&gt; As they plead for higher beings to protect them, their voices echo through the cave's wall, indicating a concealed gap in it. They cross the lucky shortcut and arrive in a large grotto pierced by multiple openings. The Mayan map points out the correct path, but time has taken its toll: the tunnel is collapsed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802375</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Are they expecting the cave to self-explore?&lt;/b&gt; The crew sits in prayer, hoping their efforts will be rewarded with a divine sign. When the only sound to answer their pleading is the rumbling protest of their hungry stomachs, they agree that the Mayan map was a fake designed for entertainment rather than actual adventure, and they leave the rolled parchment on the ground to be slowly consumed by the mud.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802377</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors can't find their bearings - the jungle swallow them.&lt;/b&gt; They fall into its pits, get clawed by its beasts, bitten by its swarms, chewed by its venomous bushes and flowers and trees. Every single living thing in the jungle tries to kill them and most succeed. Only three explorers make it back alive, swollen and feverish versions of their previous selves who babble about the Mayan map until the end of the trip.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802378</GUID><Text>The risks outweigh the rewards, ignore the map</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802379</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The map is ignored and the sailors dispirited.&lt;/b&gt; Of course, they too understand the risks. Of course, they too see the uncertainty. Of course, but isn't the whole point of expeditions to venture into the uncertain and face unknown risks?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802567</GUID><Text>A Fistful of Doubloons</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802568</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ship's coffers have been emptied!&lt;/b&gt; Your purser knew these new recruits had a wicked air about them. As soon as the ship reached port and the sailors were allowed some rest, the three landsmen merged with the local crowd and disappeared and with them went weeks of pay. The theft was planned in every minute detail - your sailors have been robbed by professionals.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802570</GUID><Text>Track the thieves down</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802572</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The fleeing footprints are easily found.&lt;/b&gt; The tracks of the thieves' limping leader stand out in the dust. The grazing light of the setting sun highlights the path for your huntsmen and leads them away from the town and closer to its river, where tracks disappear in the water. The hills rise sharply on the other side.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802574</GUID><Text>Look for a ford to cross on foot</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802576</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A safe passage!&lt;/b&gt; The crew's expertise shines as they rapidly spot a shallow part in the river and cross it without much inconvenience. They go up the sharp hill of the opposite bank and happen upon a vast enclosed field: a pen for horse breeding. A quick discussion with the owner confirms that the thieves stole several animals mere hours ago. The land beyond is barren and unfit for explorers on foot. Your crew needs horses.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802578</GUID><Text>Attempt to catch wild horses</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802580</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The tamed horses easily catch up with your prey.&lt;/b&gt; Your hunters lasso the wild animals and break them before launching them through the barren plains. The blurry hot air parts to reveal the thieves' horses, whose speed is no match for wild ones. Your riders surround them and the menace of their number and drawn pistols hushes any resistance. The sailors, satisfied and avenged, retrieve their loot and entrust the scoundrels to the local law.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802581</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors are not made to catch land animals.&lt;/b&gt; The hunt ends in failure, the most your crew saw of a wild horse being weathered tracks in the dry roads. Instead of leading your hunters to a herd, the tracks drive them to a run-down town of wooden buildings -several houses and a single saloon-, its lanterns brightening with the growing darkness. Night is well on its way and tracking the thieves seems almost impossible now.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802582</GUID><Text>Ask the locals for help</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802585</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The locals agree to help.&lt;/b&gt; Your diplomat carefully brings the subject of thieves to a man of imposing authority, the sheriff in charge of the small town. The modus operandi is familiar to him: a local gang is famous for their sneaking around foreign businessmen, but he never would have imagined they'd be so bold as to rob a ship. If the robbery was today, he says, the thieves are sure to come and celebrate at the saloon tonight.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802587</GUID><Text>Wait on the town's balconies, ready for an ambush</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802589</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A clean job.&lt;/b&gt; As soon as the thieves come into sight, your sailors stealthily lay their firearms on the rail guards of balconies and aim and fire in rapid succession. The shots resonate through the quiet town: one shot, one permanent sleeper. When the sound and smell of gunshots settle down, the sheriff salutes your crew's help in getting rid of local pests and ensures the sailors that their reputation will be made known through the West.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802590</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Rout.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors fire as soon as the gang comes into view, taking little time to aim and even less to observe their targets. The bullets graze past the thieves and upset their horses, who rear and jump before running away with their riders. A night drizzle starts falling and soon drowns their tracks. That's as far as the crew's efforts, notable but inefficient, can go.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802588</GUID><Text>Wait at the saloon, ready for a fight</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802591</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Honour and wages are retrieved.&lt;/b&gt;When the gang slams the saloon's doors open, the place is devoid of its usual chirpy atmosphere. Moon rays disclose the presence of your crew, sat on every possible chair and table and stair step and already reaching for their guns. The fight is brief. Your sailors submerge the thieves and drag them outside, roped and gagged, and salute the sheriff before heading back to the ship with the satisfaction of a job well done.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802592</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew is no match for the criminals.&lt;/b&gt; When the gang barges into the saloon, the sailors are still arguing over how to handle the fighting in such a closed space. The fight is short-lived. Your sailors lack the rough training and ability of their opponents and can barely fling insults at them, even less punches. The beaten crew is thrown outside and scampers away from the town - very aware of how lucky they are to still be alive.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802586</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew is held responsible for the deserters' actions.&lt;/b&gt; Instead of probing around to get an idea of the runaways' reputation, your diplomat immediately asks about the thieves. The men are well-known in the worst way and the locals are shocked to hear your crew hosted them, regardless of the theft - the sailors are forced to leave when surrounded by stern-looking gunslingers. The track ends here. More than money, your sailors have lost morale.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802584</GUID><Text>Avoid trouble and simply give up</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802593</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;So much effort for such a meagre reward.&lt;/b&gt; Feeling the pressure of unseen stares, your crew avoids the shady town and backs away to the harbour city and their ship. Better to decide on your own to withdraw than to be forced to, the sailors tell themselves. Frustration nibbles their thoughts as they set sail.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802579</GUID><Text>Buy horses from the breeder</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802594</GUID><Text>You can choose either to rent or buy a mount.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802595</GUID><Text>Confirm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802597</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The animals catch up with your prey in no time!&lt;/b&gt; In a flurry of dust and whinnying, the mounts assail the barren plains. The blurry hot air parts to reveal the thieves, perched atop horses already exhausted from their mishandling. Your riders surround them and the menace of their number and drawn pistols hushes any resistance. The sailors, satisfied and avenged, retrieve their loot and entrust the scoundrels to the local law.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802596</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802598</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew will make do on its own.&lt;/b&gt; The price for the withered mares reeks of scam and your sailors refuse to pay a single pound for the animals. Their observations might be influenced by the light weight of their purses.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802607</GUID><Text>Get on your horses</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802577</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew finds no guarantee of safe crossing.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors quickly get tired of the senseless search: the river's depth cannot be appraised by their untrained eyes, and each segment of the water seems both deep and shallow. The crew is too reluctant to try its luck, and abandons its search, disgruntled.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802575</GUID><Text>Create a raft to cross the river</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802599</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A safe passage!&lt;/b&gt; The raft is basic but sturdy, and it crosses the river without losing so much as a plank. The crew boards the opposite bank safely and climbs the hill rising right beyond it. On the other side, they happen upon a vast enclosed field: a pen for horse breeding. A quick discussion with the owner confirms that the thieves stole several animals mere hours ago. The land beyond is barren and unfit for explorers on foot. Your crew needs horses.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802600</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The raft can't even float.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors bind logs and dead branches together, binding them with sturdy knots but little knowledge of how to actually assemble the ropes. The raft's apparent stability tricks the builders into climbing onto it, and the raft swirls over the river, wobbling under the weight of sailors and the pressure of the current, before breaking and diving straight into the icy water. Few sailors can be rescued from the wreckage.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802573</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No tracks are found.&lt;/b&gt; The bustling harbour and the late evening insist on hiding the thieves' tracks. Your sailors are not skilled enough to pick up the faint trail inside the town itself, but they might have better luck around its outskirts.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802601</GUID><Text>Keep searching</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802603</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Finally, tracks to follow!&lt;/b&gt; Amidst the numerous footprints left by your sailors, your best huntsmen manage to find the dotted lines left in the dust by the fleeing thieves. There's no mistaking the bent pattern of their limping leader. The prints waddle to the nearest river, where they fade in the water.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802604</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Isn't this humiliation enough?&lt;/b&gt; Your crew keeps foraging through the outskirts of town, but they still cannot find any tracks.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802602</GUID><Text>Stop these futile efforts</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802605</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your purser protests but the decision is final.&lt;/b&gt; Going after the thieves in a territory they seem to know by heart while the crew itself is in foreign territory? The risk will not be taken. As the ship sails away from the harbour and the villains it hosts, your sailors mourn the plundered funds.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802571</GUID><Text>Let them be</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802606</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your purser protests but the decision is final.&lt;/b&gt; Going after the thieves in a territory they seem to know by heart while the crew itself is in foreign territory? The risk will not be taken. As the ship sails away from the harbour and the villains it hosts, your sailors mourn the plundered funds.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800227</GUID><Text>Of Unsound Mind</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800228</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The man spasms, eyes rolling, before finally falling unconscious.&lt;/b&gt; His mania had come suddenly, with eight men needed to pacify, and bind him to the mast. Some say he is possessed by daemons and must be done rid of. The officers, less credulous, seek a surer explanation. The only way to silence a worsening quarrel, is to find a solution.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800229</GUID><Text>Enlist the aid of the hypnotist</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800234</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew are delighted the man has returned to his normal self.&lt;/b&gt; The hypnotist used a pendulum to induce him into deep sleep, before imparting subliminally, some choice words. Within days the fellow is happily back at work. All are buoyant that such a severe case was so artfully cured!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800230</GUID><Text>Examine the cause of this wildness in him</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800235</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is a superb recovery in the circumstances.&lt;/b&gt; The examination uncovers a bluish contusion under the hair. 'We are to act swiftly or he shall die!' says the doctor, as he bores a drill into the man's cranium. Once the blood is drained, the resultant hole is covered with a silver coin, and the head beswaddled with bandages. The man is fully recovered within a few days, and the crew greatly impressed by the actions of the doctor.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800236</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The whole examination takes too long,&lt;/b&gt; 'though a bluish contusion is found under the hair. 'I must act or he shall soon die!' gulps the doctor, but then proceeds to faff nervously through a medicine bag, until the poor man dies on the operating table. 'You did the best you could,' a colleague offers, but there is a hollowness to it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800237</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The patient grabs the doctor's head and smashes it against the table.&lt;/b&gt; The doctor was tapping his knee to check reflex, when the devil cut loose. 'He wants putting out of his misery,' a sailor cries, once the man is wrestled to the deck again. So they cut his throat. Attention turns to the doctor, but he is a doctor no more. Injury has rendered him insensible; an eight-year-old boy trapped in the body of a man!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800238</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Hellish horror ensues,&lt;/b&gt; as the doctor insists on checking if 'ought is stuck in the throat'. As he prises open the lion's jaws, the daemon creature lurches up into his throat. So frenzied is this vampiric assault, that there is little the crew can do but to raise their pistols to the gruesomeness. When the gunsmoke clears, doctor and patient lie dead, entwined and contorted beneath a bloody dew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800231</GUID><Text>Try to calm the crew, and pray the man recovers</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800239</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew are convinced&lt;/b&gt; by the chaplain that god has a plan for this man. They agree to bind him to his bed while the chaplain prays for his fast recovery. After two weeks he still suffers gaps in his memory, and a paralysis of the face, but   thanks are given to the lord above that he is otherwise his usual self.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800240</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors are partially convinced&lt;/b&gt; there is a spiritual explanation for his deranged behaviour, but insist on chaining him to his bed. 'He must have done something terrible in the eyes of God,' they say. Despite all hope for his fast recovery, he dies not two days later, his malady forever a mystery.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800241</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The faithless crew will not trust this to God,&lt;/b&gt; but can neither agree if the possessed man should be thrown to sea, as desired by the sailors, or permitted a chance to see out his ordeal, as demanded by the officers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800242</GUID><Text>Side with the officers and warn the sailors to cooperate or suffer the consequences</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800244</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors would not dare mutiny,&lt;/b&gt; of course, and return to their stations. At first they fear the bed-ridden man will commit some terrible act while they sleep. But they need not have worried, since he dies of the unexplained malady not two days later.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800245</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors are outraged&lt;/b&gt; and their response is immediate. In greater numbers they overwhelm and restrain the officers, while the sickly subject of their fury is bound and thrown into the deep. Confidence in the leadership of the expedition is undermined and the possibility of further trouble seems never far away.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800243</GUID><Text>Convince the officers the needs of the many must prevail over the needs of the few</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800246</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No officer can deny the logic of the argument,&lt;/b&gt; yet, when the man is bound and thrown overboard they cannot help but show their grief it is for no fault of his own, and that none had knowledge with which to better help him.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800247</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'It's a bally disgrace! You dishonour a gentleman!'&lt;/b&gt; say the officers, as the man is bound and thrown overboard, 'such incompetence shall be reported to the highest authority!' Not only is a man lost, but the expedition brought into disrepute.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800232</GUID><Text>Guard him round the clock in his cabin</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800248</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There was little for the guards to report,&lt;/b&gt; but occasionally 'quelling the mad dog' with liquor. After a fortnight, the poor man recovers with no recollection of anything, and while his hand is partially paralysed, he is still able to perform his usual duties.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800249</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The damn guards are found with sacks over their heads.&lt;/b&gt; They swear they did not see their attacker, but weakly-tied hands suggest collusion. Of course the patient's bed is vacant, and he seems to be missing, permanently. After that, rumours circulate, and no-one seems to have any trust in anyone else.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800233</GUID><Text>Ignore the officers and get rid of him before it's too late</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800250</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The officers react with disgust to your decision to toss him overboard,&lt;/b&gt; and state in no uncertain terms that the whole matter will be reported. But the sailors are quite obviously relieved that his demonic presence has been exorcised.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800663</GUID><Text>The Seven-Year Itch</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800664</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew are beset by insatiable and painful itching!&lt;/b&gt; From lieutenants down to pigeon-keepers, they twist and turn in their bunks and cannot sleep. It is affecting their capacity to carry out the most basic duties, something must be done!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800665</GUID><Text>Wash more often!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800669</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Washing a splendid idea at sea? Who knew?!&lt;/b&gt; The itching is very soon forgotten, as the sailors cavort through rainbows of expurgating bubbles. The rich perfume below deck is a welcome reminder of family and bygone days.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800666</GUID><Text>Analyse the symptoms</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800670</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Only jellyfish!' says the cultivated doctor cheerfully.&lt;/b&gt; 'Our refreshing swim at that cove appears to be the cause. It must have been rife with their larvae!' The crew marvel at the clever diagnosis, and as the itching subsides, bask in the pioneering case-study they have performed for the benefit of humankind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800671</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The red welts seem to perplex the doctor.&lt;/b&gt; 'There is evidence of the parasitic,' he splutters as he peers through his magnifying glass, 'but then it could be nothing at all!'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800673</GUID><Text>Examine the cabins for some sort of parasite</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800675</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There are bedbugs everywhere!&lt;/b&gt; There must be something that can be done to exterminate these disc-bodied hangers-on!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800677</GUID><Text>Refurbish the cabins</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800679</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The matter is craftily 'put-to-bed'.&lt;/b&gt; Despite the time-consuming upheaval, the crew are surprised to have their cabins so well refurbished. 'They're too soft on us,' says a jolly cove inspecting the new bunks, but my britches haven't itched all day.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800680</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What dreary decor!'&lt;/b&gt; says the Lieutenant tartly. Matters deteriorate when some ill-fashioned bunks collapse. 'I'd rather have the itching back,' says an exhausted-looking sailor. Like others, he has to sleep out on the hard decking, until some competent craftsmen can come aboard.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800678</GUID><Text>Simply change the sheets</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800681</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is a job half-done.&lt;/b&gt; For most the problem goes away, but  some must live with the itching. Wherever the bugs' nasty little hidey-hole is, it must still reel with lousy punters, each telling stories of the sailor blood they drained the night before.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800676</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They cannot see the wood for the trees!&lt;/b&gt; Evidence of fleas would be everywhere to the right pair of eyes. Two weeks pass, and murine typhus breaks out. Rashes, fever and vomiting grip the fleas' hosts, who are never able to find the cause of their itching agony.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800674</GUID><Text>Have the afflicted bathe in holy water</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800682</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The priest's most divine bottle does the trick.&lt;/b&gt; 'This water is indeed holy!' he says, as the fearsome muscovite vodka from 1791 is uncorked and slapped over the itches of the queuing sailors. 'Shame to use it like this, but I'd rather sleep,' he cackles.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800683</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Is nothing sacred anymore?'&lt;/b&gt; Says the priest, who turns up his nose at the suggestion of using his water for something so humdrum. 'The lord hath bigger fish to fry,' he says pointedly. As well as the vile and incessant itching, the crew now have a parsimonious priest to contend with.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800672</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor is a demented quack.&lt;/b&gt; When the condition is established correctly as crusted scabies - contagious, but hardly dangerous - the doctor's experiment is for the affected to bathe in an acid solution. Needless to say, his victims do not survive their injuries. When the expedition returns, it is entirely possible he may be stripped of his profession.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800667</GUID><Text>Find somewhere to stop and be rid of it</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800684</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Sand and sun is a panacea!&lt;/b&gt; An acute sense of direction leads the ship to an island paradise. A freshwater lagoon relieves the itching, and the much-needed relaxation will stand all in good stead for the journey ahead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800685</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Bringing contagion to port might be a bad idea.&lt;/b&gt; The itching is at its worst by the time the expedition reaches the bustling alien seaport, something the local authorities don't fail to notice. The harbour-master's tug escorts you to quarantine. How do you escape?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800687</GUID><Text>Lie that the sickness isn't contagious</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800690</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The lie works like a charm.&lt;/b&gt; A doctor promptly comes aboard to confirm this hypothesis. Although she sternly points out the condition is contagious after all, she also recognises it to be a mild complaint. 'Crabs,' the translator says, face flushing. The crew are too relieved to feel embarrassed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800692</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is obvious you are lying,&lt;/b&gt; and the authorities are not impressed. They allow several days to pass, without any word on your ship's release, adversely affecting the morale of your crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800688</GUID><Text>Threaten them into letting you go</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800693</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They don't want any trouble.&lt;/b&gt; A doctor comes aboard ship and goes nervously about his business. Although the atmosphere is somewhat cagey, medicines for your crew's skin conditions are provided, and the expedition can continue on its way.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800694</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You underestimate them.&lt;/b&gt; Two surprise warships hove round the landspit and close in to firing range. There is no choice but to run. As your ship crashes wildly out between jetties, the escort ship pincers, and opens fire. The effect is catastrophic. Your modest vessel flees in tatters, and many good sailors are dead or wounded. For the rest, the itching is set to continue.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800689</GUID><Text>Await quarantine</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800695</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's a long time before the authorities deal with you,&lt;/b&gt; with bureaucracy seemingly a way of life here. When you finally have access to a medical professional, there is already a post-mortem to be conducted. It appears chemicals leeched into the water supply and caused the rashes and sickness. With the water changed, the others recover, but it cannot redeem the loss of a life.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800686</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's impossible for your aimless navigators to concentrate.&lt;/b&gt; The expedition fidgets wildly off course, with no land in sight. Meanwhile the assassin bugs continue to spread their dreadful disease. Even they'd probably make better navigators! Then there wouldn't have to be quite so much death!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800668</GUID><Text>Let them itch, it's common at sea</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800696</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is a particularly awful itch however.&lt;/b&gt; The disgusting lice infesting the ship, and discomfort thereof has many questioning the worth of your expedition. There is only so much scratching a crew can take before they lose all appetite for the journey ahead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800875</GUID><Text>Parasitic Infestation</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800877</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;These parasites must have come from the marsh goo;&lt;/b&gt; all that waist-high wading. Now they nestle deep in your crew, who, at risk of harm from their own madcap cures, really need professional help!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800878</GUID><Text>Bathe them in alcohol</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800879</GUID><Text>Treat the afflicted</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800880</GUID><Text>Hope the problem goes away.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800881</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A delectable disinfectant!&lt;/b&gt; The suffering take immense pleasure scouring themselves in a whacking great tub of the stuff. Indeed, so diverting is this new form of alcohol absorption, that even those without parasites take turns.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800882</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor concocts a panacea&lt;/b&gt;, which not only purges the belly-dwelling roundworm, but more besides. Garlic, wormwood, and lemon quietly see off a myriad other complaints of your spoon-dodging sailors.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800883</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctors disagree.&lt;/b&gt; 'Madam! Bloodletting gives our patients only a fifty-fifty chance!' says one. 'Sir, tinctures are seldom beneficial OR effective on parasites!' says the other.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800884</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It does go away, eventually.&lt;/b&gt; 'My arm looked like a wormcake for a while,' one sailor laments, 'but that little smattering of holes filled-up with pus now - signs my body is winning the war.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800885</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Mass amputation for all?!&lt;/b&gt; The festering parasites have gnawed their way to bone! Limbs must be chopped, or else their bodies shall rattle with bemaggoted cavities!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800886</GUID><Text>Try the latest tincture</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800887</GUID><Text>Risk bloodletting the patients</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800888</GUID><Text>Let nature take its course</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800889</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A fine placebo.&lt;/b&gt; As if by magic, the intestinal worms lose the will to go on. The doctor freely admits this is more likely down to positive patient attitude, than his revolting tincture.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800890</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The unpleasant medicine doesn't help.&lt;/b&gt; Constant trips to the privy are now the only release for your bug-ridden crew. The doctor admits to the failure of the tincture, but thankfully has something for diarrhoea.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800891</GUID><Text>The tincture is poison! Having seen their first shipmate choke on his dose, the rest decide they'd rather live with a six-foot tapeworm in their bellies.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800892</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Somehow it works&lt;/b&gt;, and the patients are rid of the parasite. The doctor seems unsurprised, 'human physiology may be complex, but treatment need not be.' A pretty vague case summary, but who cares?!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800893</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Perfect preparation for amputation!&lt;/b&gt; At least that's what your crazed doctor would have you believe. Once her macabre experiment is concluded there is surely only one course of action for the afflicted...the crew are aghast.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800894</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It does go away, eventually.&lt;/b&gt; 'My arm looked like a wormcake for a while,' one sailor laments, 'but that little smattering of holes filled-up with pus now - signs my body is winning the war.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800895</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Mass amputation for all?!&lt;/b&gt; The festering parasites have gnawed their way to bone! Limbs must be chopped, or else their bodies shall rattle with bemaggoted cavities!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800898</GUID><Text>Have the doctor amputate</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800900</GUID><Text>Let nature take its course</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800901</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;As good as could be expected.&lt;/b&gt; Out with parasites, in with polished peg legs and helpful hook-hands. The crew look not nearly as enthusiastic as you might think however.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800902</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Extraordinary that you trusted that quack!&lt;/b&gt; She is sideshow surgeon, carving up her victims with the zeal of a ripper, and the accuracy of a pissing schoolboy. At least the screams will die away soon enough...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800903</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Nothing can save them.&lt;/b&gt; Though a mercy that they may choose their manner of death - unmolested by the ship's quack - it is death nonetheless. The parasite has sucked the life from your expedition.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802083</GUID><Text>Cut or Lift</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802084</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Sailor under the mast!&lt;/b&gt; Weeks of harsh weather have taken their toll on the ship and the violent gusts of wind of this morning have toppled the mizzenmast. For a moment the ropes tying it to the other masts hold it in place, but there is only so much weight they can take: they break with a snap, letting the mizzenmast plummet on the deck. A sailor now wails, his leg caught under a pole twice his size.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802085</GUID><Text>Cover the leg with a mix of water and soap and pull it away</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802088</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailor is easily pulled from under the mast.&lt;/b&gt; The foamy water allows the crushed leg to slither away from the debris and the limb emerges covered in rainbow bubbles and bloody splinters. The man will live and maybe, with a miracle or two, his leg will mend.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802086</GUID><Text>Cut the leg with a bone saw</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802089</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An extreme but commendable choice.&lt;/b&gt; The sailor is given rum to drink and cloth to bite before he is held in place, his leg bound with a tight tourniquet. The doctor's labour is gruesome and the man can feel the grinding cuts as they tear through him, and he screams through the cloth and he howls and he roars - and yet the doctor stays composed and focused. When the leg is finally cut and the sailor dragged away, the crew feels that they are in capable hands.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802090</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Butchery.&lt;/b&gt; The doctor's hands tremble more than his victim does, and the saw draws zigzags in the flesh, each cut unable to connect with the previous ones. The trapped sailor's screams become whimpers, then silence. The doctor has to be stopped before he can ruin any more of the unfortunate corpse, and his blood-clad figure sends a warning to whoever might ever need his help in the future.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802087</GUID><Text>Lift the mast with a makeshift lever</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802091</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The man is freed.&lt;/b&gt; Using one of the partners broken by the mast, the crew fits the sturdy pieces of timber between the deck and the fallen mast, adding plank after plank in the opening and gradually raising the mast with ropes and pulleys tied to the mainmast. They manage to lift the mast long enough to free the sailor, and the doctor immediately tends to his crushed leg.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802092</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The vague idea of a lever never becomes real.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors try to lift the mizzenmast by rolling logs underneath, but the huge wooden pole is far too heavy for its rolling movement to be controlled. The mast lurches forward and rolls from the sailor's leg to his chest, pushing his insides out. The view stays with the sailors for days before they can finally reach a decent harbour, get rid of the broken mast, and clean up the grisly mess underneath.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802710</GUID><Text>Bottles Found in the Sea</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802711</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Castaways request your help, but where could they be?&lt;/b&gt; Shark-baiting is a common distraction for your sailors. Their latest catch provided much more entertainment than expected: in its belly was a bottle and in the bottle were three sheets of paper, each a copy of the same message in different languages. Piecing together the documents to make up for their weathered content, the crew can make out a call for help and a latitude, but nothing more.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802712</GUID><Text>Examine the entrails of the shark for clues</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802715</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The stomach of the shark reveals where it's been.&lt;/b&gt; Glittering corals, exotic scales, characteristic fish bones. Your doctors finish their inspection of the shark's entrails and confirm the destination: to the Southern coral barriers! When the ship reaches the correct latitude, several islands litter the horizon. The crew hesitates to come closer. The water is shallower than usual and filled with sharp coral reefs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802718</GUID><Text>Navigate closer to the islands and their reefs</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802720</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your ship avoids the deadly reefs and finds the castaways!&lt;/b&gt; The vessel groans as it swims through the limpid waters, the deepest corals reflecting its shadow as it avoids them. It takes a short while to find the castaways, entrenched among the dunes of a secluded beach and sprouting from it with squeals of joy and disbelief. Their captain offers his unalienable loyalty and your crew gladly welcomes the newcomers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802721</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ship cannot pass the underwater barrier.&lt;/b&gt; Despite your navigator's efforts, the ship bumps against the coral reef - the manoeuvre is too complex and too risky for her. The crew is forced to turn its back to the paradisiacal islands. Whether the castaways were real, whether they were indeed stranded here, they will never know.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802719</GUID><Text>Stay away and have the look-out search for castaways</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802722</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Found them!&lt;/b&gt; Your look-out shows their brilliance when they spot the thin smoke line of a campfire in the distance. A dinghy is sent to retrieve the castaways and comes back filled to the brim with men in overgrown beards, torn clothes, and awed faces. Their captain pledges himself to your crew and, once shaved and washed, the castaways prove themselves to be excellent sailors and even better companions.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802723</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The look-out draws a blank.&lt;/b&gt; Scanning the islands from afar is a difficult exercise, made even harder by the lack of experience. The crew soon realizes that it will never find anyone from such a distance. Reluctant to risk the ship's integrity over the mere possibility of the castaways' existence, your sailors choose to leave and forget.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802724</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The homemade autopsy is a mess.&lt;/b&gt; The shark's entrails are cut along with their contents and spilled over the deck is a nauseous mass of gore and artefacts of unknown origin. The doctor cannot make sense of the anarchy he created.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802725</GUID><Text>Interpret the patterns in the shark's entrails</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802727</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Relentless faith guides the most deserving.&lt;/b&gt; In the spilled gut of the shark, your navigators see the shapes of islands, your doctors see the patterns of life forms, your boatswain sees the promise of rewards. Driven by an inner force beyond simple greed, the crew sails past coral reefs and insidious currents and finds the island on which the castaways had been waiting for rescue. Their relief is glorious and their captain promises to serve your crew!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802728</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There is nothing to find but deceit.&lt;/b&gt; Your cooper burns sage among the remains of the shark and sniffs the lumpy smoke. If forces do talk to him, they might have been beyond what he could handle: he suddenly pounces on the closest sailor, crushing her throat between his hands. Three more fall before his frenzy drives him overboard with an otherworldly scream. The castaways are cursed and the sailors mourn their comrades for the rest of the trip.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802726</GUID><Text>Divination? Let's just stop now</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802729</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Shark, bottle and messages are thrown overboard.&lt;/b&gt; Several sailors protest against the rash decision and would have preferred to exhaust all options before giving up, or at least keep the messages to share them at the next harbour. The imagined blame and grief of the castaways haunt them for a while.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802713</GUID><Text>Map the islands matching the partial coordinates</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802730</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The search defines a searchable area.&lt;/b&gt; Many islands match the latitude but much less could be mapped on an actual shipping route. By deducing where the castaways' ship might have gone, your navigators identify a handful of islands which could host the castaway. After two weeks of smooth sailing, your ship reaches the area: a necklace of islands linked by strands of deadly coral reef.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802731</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your navigator is overwhelmed by the mass of possibilities.&lt;/b&gt; Unable to find a proper searching method and define a list of reasonable proportions, they abandon their task and admit the crew might as well try to work out the contents of the entrails. It is said as a joke, however, some sailors consider the idea.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802714</GUID><Text>There's no time to spare for such things</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802732</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The bottle and its messages are thrown back into the sea.&lt;/b&gt; The crew's regrets drift away with the bottle and the castaways are soon forgotten.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802734</GUID><Text>The Preacher</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802735</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your chaplain is going overboard with his preaching.&lt;/b&gt; Blaming the expedition's mishaps and hazards on the supposed heresy of the ship's officers, the man of faith manages to rouse the gradual distrust and anger of the sailors. His preaching is now part of the crew's daily routine. His words find echo in the mouths of the sailors, and your lieutenants can see their authority slipping away.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802736</GUID><Text>Demonstrate that his doubts are fuelled by a mental illness</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802739</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The man of faith belongs to an asylum.&lt;/b&gt; Your doctor interrupts the chaplain's daily sermon and accuses him of megalomania, listing the traits of the madness: desire for attention, desire for control, desire to rouse the paranoia of others in order to match one's own. The portrait is a perfect depiction of the chaplain, and, despite their former affection for the man, the sailors agree that he should be sedated with laudanum for the rest of the trip.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802740</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor only proves his own paranoia.&lt;/b&gt; Your doctor interrupts the chaplain's daily sermon with a loud declaration, stating that the man of faith is, in fact, a soul tormented by a mental illness. With all eyes on him, your doctor utters a list of personal opinions rather than medical facts, and the chaplain welcomes his doubts with benevolence. His influence flourishes and your lieutenants have to make do with him for the rest of the trip.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802737</GUID><Text>Discredit him in a direct confrontation</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802741</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat has a greater way with words.&lt;/b&gt; She silently enters the lower deck during the chaplain's daily preaching and waits in a corner of a room. When the man of faith finally loses his nerve and asks her what she wants, she lists two hours worth of the chaplain's arguments and, without pause, offers counterpoints for each of them. The humiliation is magnificent and the chaplain's babbling defence convinces the crew of his puerility. They lose interest.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802742</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat was not ready to face the chaplain.&lt;/b&gt; She confronts the preacher before the crew and flaunts her interpretation of the chaplain's mistakes, stating how wrong he is without taking into account the weeks of argument he had built with his followers. Her diatribe convinces none but herself, and the chaplain simply remarks that her anger is proof of his being right. Your lieutenants have to make do with his whims for the rest of the trip.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802738</GUID><Text>Simply punish him without taking measures against his ideas</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802743</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Not the most diplomatic solution, but it works.&lt;/b&gt; Trusted sailors interrupt the chaplain during his daily preaching and drag him to the upper deck, where your first mate welcomes the man of faith with a devoted flogging. The display of violence mostly proves the preacher's point, but the menace of the officers' ire is greater than the crew's distrust in them. The trip resumes in a climate of tension.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802799</GUID><Text>Taken In, Broken Out</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802800</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Behind bars!&lt;/b&gt; The prolonged stay of your ship in this harbour is not a willed one. Obscure laws were breached and your whole crew was arrested under the pretence that borders, whose nature remains unknown, were not respected. Heavily armed foreigners lead your crew through the sinuous roads of their city and into the local jail, and after passing by a row of freshly hanged criminals, the sailors are locked up. Only two guards keep watch, their heads bobbing with fatigue. Are they underestimating your crew?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802801</GUID><Text>Poison the guards!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802804</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Two guards are not enough to resist your science.&lt;/b&gt; The doctor brings out a sachet of vials and packets and produces leathery pouches filled with white powders, some matte, some glittering like sugar. He mixes a bit of this one and a bit of that one, gauging measures with the eye of the seasoned practitioner, then calls to the guards. When the unsuspecting wardens are close enough, the doctor blows the mixture in their face. The men drop dead!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802806</GUID><Text>Disguise as guards and escort the rest of the crew</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802808</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The escape is flawless.&lt;/b&gt; Two of your sailors don the guards' uniforms and drag the rest of the chained crew through the prison. When they are stopped at the exit, they mimic the local accent, briefly explain the liberation, and kick one of the chained sailors for good measure. The legitimate wardens buy the lie! It takes an even greater effort to refrain from laughing before reaching the ship and leaving the port.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802809</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An attempt way beyond their ability.&lt;/b&gt; Two sailors put on the guards' uniforms and lead the crew through the prison, until legitimate guards stop them and enquire about the strange cortege. The disguised men's fidgety attitude and suspiciously foreign accent is enough to convince the wardens to check their original cell: the bodies are found and with them comes the heavy charge of murder. The following day, the trial is held.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802812</GUID><Text>Offer to pay a fine, however high it might be</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802815</GUID><Text>Confirm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802817</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The price is high, but fair.&lt;/b&gt; Most of the expedition's budget is squandered in the brutal fine and if the crew is cleared of their charges, they find themselves forced to ration their supplies for the rest of the trip. The doctor and his accursed ideas are blamed and the man is turned into a scapegoat: his rations are regularly stolen, damaging his health and abilities, and, worse, the crew blatantly avoids his treatments.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802816</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802818</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Who would accept such a meager payment?&lt;/b&gt; Murder is not a subject to be triffled with and the foreign court makes its opinion clear: your crew will pay in the hardest way possible. To show that they value life more than your sailors, the judges impose a non-lethal punishment and insist on this point, devising a program of forced labour and precise observation to make sure the sailors suffer as much as possible without dying. Months of hell follow before the crew can leave.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802813</GUID><Text>Pretend these actions were a demand from the higher-ups and have the crew repudiate Her Majesty</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802819</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;That lie is believable, but it doesn't erase your crew's crimes.&lt;/b&gt; The foreign judges put aside any idea of death sentence and focus on finding a punishment befitting the crime: the crew is arranged into a procession and made to cross the city in chains, while chanting the ill-will of their Queen. Their patriotism tainted, the sailors never dare to pronounce her name again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802820</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Who would believe such an obvious lie?&lt;/b&gt; Why would their Queen ask for such a menial task as poisoning oversea guards? To match the crime, the crew's lieutenants are forced to drink hemlock solutions and trapped in a single cell with the rest of the crew. The lieutenants gag and wheeze for days of agony, their skin puffing and their muscles stiffening in impossible positions until their breathing itself is locked into place. Only then are the sailors allowed to leave.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802807</GUID><Text>Avoid drawing any attention and sneak outside</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802821</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The perfect crime!&lt;/b&gt; Despite their numbers, your sailors manage to sneak through the prison and into the streets, where they become shadows under the moonless night. Led by your most competent hunters, they creep through back alleys and backyards until the obscurity delivers them below their ship. Feeling like the protagonists of an adventure novel and revelling in the sentiment, they leave the harbour in the gliding vessel - all lights off and no sound made.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802822</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They are caught!&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors' lack of discretion is awkward and it is only a matter of minutes before a patrol spots them. Without any prepared disguise or lie, they are instantly arrested and, worse, the bodies of the poisoned guards are found on the way back to their cell. The next morning, they are judged not for their meager trespassing, but for actual murder.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802805</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor showcases his ignorance.&lt;/b&gt; He produces a pouch of arsenic before calling the guards. When the jailers are close enough, the doctor is ready to blow the powder in their face - however, his lack of knowledge of the poison's properties backfires: the soft inhalation of the doctor is enough to bring the highly volatile poison to his lips, and he leaps back, coughing and wheezing. The guards immediately understand this was attempted murder.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802802</GUID><Text>Dig an escape tunnel!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802823</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A nice display of craftsmanship.&lt;/b&gt; The crew digs a tunnel with skill, taking care of reinforcing the structure and analysing the soil's nature as they progress. They avoid the most friable sections of the city's ground and emerge on the coast, exactly as calculated. Your ship is not too far but a frigate guards it. Its lights are off, the guards might be sleeping and not actually keeping watch.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802827</GUID><Text>Stealthily sail away</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802829</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Swift as a whisper.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors embark on the ship and deploy its sails in an excruciatingly slow manner, timing their flapping and clinking with the melody of the backwash. The vessel creaks softly and lets the sea take it, drifting away from the harbour with delicate movements of to and fro - soon the city is but a point on the horizon, and the sailors allow themselves to explode in a clamour of celebration.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802831</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Ridiculously visible.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors tiptoe past the guarding frigate, their shadows stretching across the whole deck, their stressed whispers ringing through the night. As a testimony to their poor hunting skill, it takes a barrel in their cheeks for them to realize they have been spotted. The next morning, the judges' verdict takes into account the escape attempt and condemn half of your crew to a month of forced labour.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802832</GUID><Text>Offer to pay a fine instead</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802835</GUID><Text>Confirm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802837</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Bribery is a reasonable option.&lt;/b&gt; The payment offered satisfies the judges, who agree to let your sailors go. The crew mutters about the absurd trial and its even more absurd resolution, but their relief shows.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802836</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802838</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Not enough.&lt;/b&gt; The judges scoff at your attempt to bribe them with a so-called fine, and advise your crew to aim for a higher amount next time. To show they are not cheap, they extend their penalty to two months of forced labour and place the sailors under the tightest surveillance. The two months are a mixture of menial and unrewarding tasks and frequent and unwarranted whipping.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802833</GUID><Text>Force your crew into complying with the unreasonable demand</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802839</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew complies.&lt;/b&gt; Following their superiors' orders, the sailors accept the judges' penalty and fulfil their obligations to the best of their abilities. One month of forced labour seems harsh even for the local population, who supports the crew's effort and vouch for their liberation: the crew earns an early release, tired but touched by the unexpected appreciation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802840</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew refuses to comply.&lt;/b&gt; The insistence of your first mate cannot convince the sailors of sacrificing themselves for the good of the crew, and the heated debate that follows is cut short by the judges. If your crew cannot decide who to send into forced labour, all of them will go! Forced to submit, the crew invests its strength into one month of meaningless tasks and incessant bickering among themselves.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802828</GUID><Text>Bombard the frigate as you leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802841</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An explosive escape!&lt;/b&gt; The crew feels whole again aboard their ship, and they now have the tools to face their opponents. The loaded canons fire a volley of precise blasts on the foreign frigate and its docking harbour, setting the whole coast aflame. Your ship sails away with the blaze in its back, a vision of grandiose might which fills the sailors with pride.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802842</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A failed attempt.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors lack the habits required to load the canons under the cover of the night. Misguided movements and poor knowledge of the armament makes the canons overflow with powder. When they are fired, the weapons explode and take their gunner with them, offering a loud indication of the escapees' position. The crew is seized and sent back to their cell. At dawn, the judges sentence half the crew to a month of forced labour.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802825</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A dead end.&lt;/b&gt; The crew can handle basic digging, but their progress is reluctant, slowed by the constant fear of being buried in the makeshift tunnel. At the first obstacle they encounter, a large foundation pillar which blocks the way, all sailors hurriedly agree that there is nothing more to be done with the tunnel. They regain the cell, relieved.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802826</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Buried alive.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors have but a vague idea of how to dig an escape tunnel. They grind the earth with their bare hands, the pungent soil getting stuck under their nails and lining their clothes, hair, skin. As air comes to lack so does their judgement and the crew pushes forward, blind to the crumbling rock. The tunnel collapses on them and what few sailors were still outside are judged and released without any sentence - the death of their companions is punishment enough.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802803</GUID><Text>Prepare your defence for the incoming trial</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802844</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An epic trial!&lt;/b&gt; At the first chance to speak, your crew engages in an extensive and thrilling retelling of its adventures, captivating the audience and the judges. They climb and rock benches to mimic past naval battles, embark the public by asking them timely and suspenseful questions, modify their tales according to the audience's whims. Their trespassing is made part of the story and as they retell the trial itself, the judges insist on letting them go. They leave as heroes!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802849</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your defence doesn't move the judges.&lt;/b&gt; The trial follows obscure local laws and their meandering unravelling goes beyond what your diplomat is used to. Her words stumble upon the judges' traps, and her lack of understanding of the legal subtleties of the situation is obvious to anyone. To the dismay of your crew, the judges' verdict is harsh: one month of public labour for at least half of your sailors.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802851</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat is beyond awkward.&lt;/b&gt; At the trial, she interrupts the judges to insist on meaningless details and points out not your crew's innocence, but the reasons why their guilt is, to quote her, not that bad. Her lack of professionalism and conviction is irritating and the judges interrupt the hearing with a hasty judgement just to stop her. Your crew is coerced into one full month of forced labour, a disproportionate and disheartening sentence.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800171</GUID><Text>The Inspector</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800172</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'I do hope you've nothing to hide?'&lt;/b&gt; smirks the Royal Inspector, as his soldiers help him aboard from the row boat. Sailors twitch. Your ship is certain to contravene her majesty's law, since it has encroached into demilitarised waters.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800173</GUID><Text>Show the Inspector a Royal Permit</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800177</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Very good'&lt;/b&gt;, grimaces the Royal Inspector, scarcely concealing his displeasure at having to let you off the hook. His remonstrations with his soldiers as he wobbles aboard the row boat are a great source of amusement for the crew in days to come.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800174</GUID><Text>Threaten him and his soldiers</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800178</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Inspector's lip wobbles.&lt;/b&gt; 'I beg you,' he says, 'I have a gift, if only you will spare us.' Sure enough, the gift is brought aboard as promised. But it is only once the Inspector and his soldiers are gone, that it feels safe enough to inspect the new acquisition.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800179</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Inspector's face pales&lt;/b&gt; as he eyes the tigerish crew. He bows, and takes a half-step backward - a signal for his soldiers to disembark with him. Once gone, the crew breathe a great sigh of relief, knowing it to have been a close shave.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800180</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'This is far from over!'&lt;/b&gt; the Inspector snarls as he evacuates his men to the row boat. Sure enough, back aboard the royal clipper, he is seen making preparations to attack.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800185</GUID><Text>Set sail and try to outrun them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800187</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Slippery as an eel,&lt;/b&gt; steady navigation keeps your ship on the windward side, just out of the Inspector's clutches. After a tense pursuit he is forced to give up, to the crew's great relief.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800188</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Though the ungainly clipper is outmanoeuvred,&lt;/b&gt; the expedition is now many miles off course, and your ship's exhausted navigators must summon all their remaining stamina to get things back on track.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800189</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's upsetting that the Inspector's clipper&lt;/b&gt; is near out of sight, when a hopeful last shot finds its mark, crashing in the main deck of your ship, and killing a luckless sailor. Despite having escaped, the crew are rattled by such ill luck.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800190</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Complete confusion among the navigators&lt;/b&gt; makes your ship a sitting duck, and the Inspector's clipper gleefully riddles it with cannonfire. Many die or are wounded, and the ship is left in shreds.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800186</GUID><Text>Sink the toad!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800191</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The last they expect is a quick counter.&lt;/b&gt; Surprised and windless, they're an easy mark. Your cannons flog the Inspector's clipper without reply, and before long, it is bubbling to the depths. The relieved crew scout the flotsam for spoils.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800192</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Though the royal clipper has it worse,&lt;/b&gt; it also deals significant damage to your ship in the chaotic exchange. With casualties and repairs on both sides, the ships agree to part, so that they may lick their wounds.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800193</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The speed and power of the royal clipper&lt;/b&gt; is impossible to match despite best efforts. Your ship takes significant damage, and a young sailor is killed by shrapnel. Retreat is the only option. Mercifully the Inspector chooses not to make pursuit.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800194</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The superior clipper chews through your ship&lt;/b&gt; with its dread bank of cannons - the ruthless Inspector intent on bringing traitors to their knees. 'We surrender!' the crew cry, but the plea falls on deaf ears. Once he has shredded the ship to bits, the smug Inspector turns his clipper about, and disappears into the distance.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800181</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There is a commotion&lt;/b&gt; and the Inspector's soldiers are already among the crew. Being exceptionally well-drilled, they quickly force the crew to drop their weapons. 'Now,' says the Inspector, 'if you are quite finished, I'd like to continue my inspection of your vessel!'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800195</GUID><Text>Allow him to inspect the ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800197</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Though this appears to be a trade vessel,'&lt;/b&gt; the Inspector says, 'Combat was a consideration when these sails were fashioned - unacceptable in Her Majesty's seas. Unless…' he winks grotesquely, '...we can come to some arrangement?'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800198</GUID><Text>Trade with the Inspector (Bribe)</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800200</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Load these crates aboard the clipper!&lt;/b&gt; What are you waiting for?' he huffs to his men. When they are done, he smirks and offers the merest of bows, before sailing away with the plunder.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800199</GUID><Text>Take consequences</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800201</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'You will remain here until they are dismantled...'&lt;/b&gt; trills the Inspector, '...those perverse modifications to your sails contravening sovereign law of the sea.' As the nit-picking Inspector leaves, it is clear an arduous refit is needed before your expedition will be allowed to continue.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800196</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'This is obviously a military vessel,'&lt;/b&gt; the Inspector says, 'in sovereign sea subject to the amnesty.' He toys with the gold button of his greatcoat. 'There will be severe consequences, unless... I hope you don't intend to offer me a bribe?'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800202</GUID><Text>Trade with the Inspector (Bribe)</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800203</GUID><Text>Take consequences</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800205</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'I don't know what you were thinking,&lt;/b&gt; bringing an armed ship into these peaceful waters,' he says, 'but I take great pleasure in imposing upon you. the longest possible route around.' Once the Inspector has gone, the crew look to one another in dismay.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800182</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A disastrous melee ensues,&lt;/b&gt; in which the crew do not acquit themselves well. Some are skewered, the rest disarmed. The Inspector calls three captive sailors forward. 'Hang these men,' he says, and they are promptly strung from a beam until dead. Your ship, he decrees, must leave sovereign waters and take the long way round.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800184</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A disastrous melee ensues,&lt;/b&gt; in which the crew do not acquit themselves well. Some are skewered, the rest disarmed. The Inspector picks out the captive specialist. 'Hang this traitor,' he says, and promptly strings them from a beam until dead. Your ship, he decrees, must leave sovereign waters and take the long way round.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800175</GUID><Text>Talk him out of the inspection</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800206</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Rather excellent company",&lt;/b&gt; says the Inspector over a glass of port, "I've been dying for something to break the tedium of the sea." Surprising even his own soldiers, the Inspector demands a gift be brought over from the clipper to mark the occasion. Of course, when he finally leaves, the crew collapse about in relief.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800207</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Very well,'&lt;/b&gt; says the Inspector, after being given the first mate's 'special tour' of nothing in particular. He silently surveys the vessel for a torturous moment, before declaring 'it all seems above board.' Of course, as soon as he and his soldiers have disembarked, the crew of your ship collapse about in grievous relief.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800208</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Save your breath, windbag,'&lt;/b&gt; says the Inspector, with an air of a man accustomed to weaselling. 'Show me the damn ship, or I shall become vexed!'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800209</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'You've talked yourself into very serious trouble,'&lt;/b&gt; the Inspector sneers, pointing to three unlucky sailors. 'Hang them,' he says, and they are promptly strung from a beam until dead. Your ship, he decrees, must leave sovereign waters and take the long way round.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800210</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'You've talked yourself into very serious trouble,'&lt;/b&gt; the Inspector sneers, and points at your specialist. 'Hang this traitor,' he says, and promptly strings them from a beam until dead. Your ship, he decrees, must leave sovereign waters and take the long way round.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801607</GUID><Text>The Trial</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801609</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew faces the bloody customs of foreign lands.&lt;/b&gt; After a night of feasting, the sailors believe that meeting the foreign prince and his sea-traveling court is the highlight of their trip. However, morning comes with news of a sudden death among the court, and your crew is immediately accused of murder. The prince demands a trial by combat and your men are left with little freedom but the choice of the challenge's nature.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801610</GUID><Text>Send your strongest fighter for a brawl</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801613</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What could a lord do against a sea-forged champion?&lt;/b&gt; The prince's warrior is nothing more than a scarecrow in shiny armor, and your own cotton-clad fighter scoffs at his tacky opponent. The walking wardrobe is tripped, grabbed, and thrown overboard in a single movement. As per foreign laws, your crew receives compensation and their name is cleared.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801614</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No word is brutal enough to describe your opponent.&lt;/b&gt; If his plate armor is scaled to match the man inside, then that man is a giant. The human mountain reaches to grab your fighter and crushes his skull like he would an apple. Word of your crew's feebleness and alleged crimes is sent for all cities to know and spread.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801611</GUID><Text>Send your best shot for a pistol duel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801615</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your gunslinger shoots faster than his own shadow.&lt;/b&gt; His opponent drops to the ground before anyone can see or even understand that a gun has been fired, and only the banging sound and fuming barrel testify to the attack. The prince wonders how lucky your sharpshooter is, then reluctantly graces the crew and presents them with compensation for his offence.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801616</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Speed is not in your gunslinger's vocabulary.&lt;/b&gt; The prince's duelist, displaying the look of men who fill graves but never dig them, is the sharpest shooter your sailors have ever seen. Your best shot is dead before he even touches the handle of his gun. Judging his passing to be too low a price, the prince randomly selects men among your crew and has them hanged for good measure.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801612</GUID><Text>Send your brightest officer for a trial of wits</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801617</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The foreigners are drawn in by your officer's pace.&lt;/b&gt; He inspects the body, noticing knife cuts of varying depths and bleeding. Through methodical questioning, the officer presses the foreigners and reveals the deception: each wound was made by a different hand, the victim was killed by all of them! The prince buys the sailors' silence and they leave wondering what could have motivated the curious murder.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801618</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A mute would have pleaded better.&lt;/b&gt; The officer engages in a battle of arguments with the prince's vizier, and each of his meager claims are met with factual evidence of their contrary. The prince cuts the exchange with exasperation and has the officer taken to be quartered till torn apart as a final judgement for the supposed crime. No scream ever matches the ones heard that day.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802020</GUID><Text>The Trial</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802021</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;These hoodlums are asking for it.&lt;/b&gt; To each harbour its own ill-famed tavern, and this one is no exception. While your crew enjoys a beer at the counter, the tavern's door slams open, the bartender stiffens and the volume of conversations dwindles: the newcomers are regulars of the bad kind. One of the scruffy men elbows your doctor and gasps as the alcohol splashes on his unkempt clothes. He immediately grabs your sailor by the collar and demands an apology.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802022</GUID><Text>They want to fight? Let them come!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802025</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew crushes them.&lt;/b&gt; The collar-grabbed doctor slaps away the hand of the hoodlum, seizes his sleeve and pulls him above his shoulder, sending him to crash into a table. With a roar, the other thugs pounce on your sailors who greet them with jabs to the chin and sternum, downing the attackers with no more than two hits per man - the seconds for the pleasure of good fighting form. The tavern applauds the action and the bartender offers a round to celebrate the deserved beating.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802026</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew overestimated themselves.&lt;/b&gt; As he calls for the other sailors to help, the doctor gets his head smashed into the counter. His crewmates scream for revenge and look like toddlers agitating their little arms to try and hit the big bad guys. The thugs are not in the mood to play along, and one of them stabs a bawling sailor in the liver to make them shut up. They slowly die as the thugs depart, leaving the tavern in a stupor.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802023</GUID><Text>Offer them a drink to ease the tension</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802027</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The language of alcohol is universal.&lt;/b&gt; The thugs take you up on your offer and eye the sailors' purses as they pass the money around to pay for the beers. As the first round arrives, one of the hoodlums speaks up and announces that they will have a drinking contest with the crew. The idea is one-sided and weirdly different from their previous aggressive attitude.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802029</GUID><Text>Show them the drinking ability of seafarers</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802031</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They call that catpiss strong?&lt;/b&gt; There's no question regarding who wins the drinking contest: your crew is still standing and enjoying the beers long after the thugs have hit the ground, curled into whatever their stomach rejected. The pungent smell of vomit and cheap ale does not deter the sailors, who casually finish their steins, pay for them, and drag the hoodlums to the closest man of law.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802032</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What kind of liquid fire do they make this with?&lt;/b&gt; The crew is used to strong drinks and exotic ales, but the tavern's special mixture of bourbon, sugar and Ricard is way past what they can handle. The thugs are accustomed to this local horror and barely wobble while your sailors pass out one after the other. When they wake up, obviously, their purses are missing.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802030</GUID><Text>Drug their drinks to avoid the confrontation</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802033</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;War anaesthetics are remarkably useful against small-time thugs.&lt;/b&gt; After a few rounds spent boasting their virile resistance to any kind of liquor, the crew notices the drop in attention of their opponents and their doctor seizes the opportunity, lacing the incoming mugs with just the right dosage of chloroform. The snoring hoodlums are delivered to the local authorities, who enjoy the unexpected present.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802034</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The dosage doesn't put the thugs to sleep: it kills them.&lt;/b&gt; The doctor sidles among the thugs, lacing their drinks and snickering in expectation. Soon the effects appear: the gang shows drowsiness, then nausea, loses control of their movements and tumbles against the counter, their faces taking on a waxy yellow color. The crew can do nothing as the hoodlums break into seizures and foam at the mouth. They win the drinking contest by default, murderers of their opponents.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802028</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Bribing them with alcohol doesn't seem to work.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew invites the men to sit and share a beer, on them, to try and bring the tension down. The thug doesn't let go of the doctor and points at the aligned liquors behind the bartender. A glass of all of these, he says, and a bottle of your best whatever. That's way more than they can drink and way more than your sailors can afford.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802035</GUID><Text>If it's a fight they want, they'll get one</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802036</GUID><Text>Pay up</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802037</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew is humiliated.&lt;/b&gt; They empty their purses trying to pay for the excessive demands of the thugs. Ale. Stew. Liquors. Meats. When sunrise pushes the hoodlums to leave the tavern, the sailors are stuck with cooking, dishwashing and dust-wiping until the bartender considers their debt paid.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802024</GUID><Text>This is a waste of time, simply apologize</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802038</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors apologize through gritted teeth.&lt;/b&gt; Pleased by their groveling, the thugs do not pester them anymore, yet the heavy stares of the other clients push your crew to leave the tavern. Next time, they will show them. Next time.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800336</GUID><Text>The Minefield</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800337</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;At the cry of 'mines!', all rush to the prow.&lt;/b&gt; Sure enough, several of the conical terrors bob seductively below. 'Who knows how many of these infernal machines have passed us by, or yet await us. A false move, and this sea shall be a lake of fire! What the devil do we do?'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800338</GUID><Text>Use dynamite to start a chain reaction</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800339</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'The way ahead is clear as the eye can see!'&lt;/b&gt; says the delighted officer, folding up his telescope. As the last motes of fire trail down into the waves and fizzle, the crew can but admire such brave use of dynamite. 'Better than fireworks!' says another, 'The men have never been so entertained!'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800340</GUID><Text>Try to navigate the minefield</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800341</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'We are masters of the sea!'&lt;/b&gt; sing the triumphant crew, as the ship weaves easily beyond the last line of mines. 'Even Odysseus, when faced with Scylla and Charybdis, lost men. We have lost none of our company, and our bonds only strengthen!' Soon, a special bottle is being uncorked, and toasts raised to the continued success of the expedition!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800342</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'What was that noise?' gulps the helmsman,&lt;/b&gt; but fortunately a metallic scraping is not the prelude to a mighty boom. As the ship is fitfully steered betwixt the mines, hearts palpitate, and sailors wring sweat from their jerseys. When the all clear is finally given, there is not a sailor who fails to offer up a prayer to their goddess.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800343</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;While at first plain sailing, the minefield is now gooey with danger.&lt;/b&gt; A line of densely-packed mines stand between the ship and freedom. 'With some makeshift device, we can clear the path ahead,' explains the officer, 'I'm afraid to say, it is the only way we shall get out of this in one piece.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800348</GUID><Text>Build that device</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800349</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'She survived! It worked!' calls the lookout,&lt;/b&gt; as makeshift grapples trailing behind the little dinghy are able to hook the mines aside. Relief only comes, of course, once the expedition ship is clear of this last line of mines. 'How did we get in such a pickle?' says one. 'At least we're out of it,' says another.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800350</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A nervous sailor rows towards the line of mines.&lt;/b&gt; The makeshift grappling hooks trailing behind his dinghy are intended to drag mines out of the path of the expedition ship. Unfortunately the sailor is a sacrificial goat. A grapple shatters the horns of a nearby mine, and the boat and its sailor explode in plume. Safe passage means nothing to those from whom a good friend was taken.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800351</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The idea is a terrible one from the start.&lt;/b&gt; The lengthy poles, comprised of other poles, are unwieldy and inaccurate, even in the hands of a several strong men. The crew's attempt to poke mines away when they draw near is suicide. Two booms come in succession, and a few feeble cheers at escape are drowned by the deafening wails. Few are left to bail water, when so many lie dead or injured.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800344</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The awfulness has barely begun.&lt;/b&gt; Restless waves conceal a thickening of the mines, and the ship's haphazard path makes impact inevitable. 'Brace!' scream port-side, just prior to a portion of men and timber being propelled violently upward. That no further detonations follow is of little relief to a crew who have lost many good sailors, and sustained such significant damage to their ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800352</GUID><Text>Go through diplomatic papers in search of any clues</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800353</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The search is a fruitful one.&lt;/b&gt; The well-organised diplomatic library includes a comprehensive folio of papers on nearby mine positions. This enables the navigators to chart a safe course through the waters. The very same paper remarks that the mines were moored during the war, in order to protect a now-disused outpost. You stop by the outpost and pick up anything that looks useful.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800354</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The search is worthwhile.&lt;/b&gt; After a few hours scouring the diplomatic archives, a paper on nearby mine positions is found. This gives the navigators the difficult task of charting a safe course through the waters. No-one is quite sure if the information given is up-to-the-minute, but when the last line of mines is cleared, all are suitably relieved.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800355</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The documents in the ship archives at first seem exact.&lt;/b&gt; A map is discovered showing the mine positions. It is only once a course has been plotted, and your ship is sailing at speed on its supposedly safe track, that a magnificent bang has the whole crew scrambling. The speed seemed to soften the mine's devastation, but there is still a nasty hole in the hull. A second glance at the map shows it is rather out-of-date. The reckless blunder has cost no lives, but the significant task of repair greatly wearies the crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800356</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Optimism makes way for abject terror,&lt;/b&gt; as the map of mines that is found and used for navigation turns out to be completely false. Terrible detonations devastate the ship's timbers, and countless lives are lost. 'Misinformation is worse than no information,' an officer laments, as his tears bleed the ink of the erroneous chart, which as it happens, refers to a different stretch of water.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800357</GUID><Text>Turn around and try to escape</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800358</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A few saintly volunteers approach,&lt;/b&gt; offering to scout back the way you came and ease your escape. Asked if they aren't afraid of the cone-shaped mines, they reply 'The lord will see us through.'</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800359</GUID><Text>Allow them to go ahead</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800361</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The volunteers exude calm,&lt;/b&gt; as their lone dinghy traces a path much akin to that which got you into this mess. Although their silent vigil transports you to safety, all agree they should never have ended up in a minefield in the first place.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800362</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;While the path the volunteers cut is a true one,&lt;/b&gt; it does not account for the difference in size between the two ships. It only takes a narrow graze to explode one of the mines, and though no lives are lost, the damage to your ship is significant. The crew are dismayed by the situation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800363</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;For the godless dinghy, doom seems inevitable&lt;/b&gt; the moment it drops and a man slops overboard. This inauspicious beginning foreshadows the disaster to follow. Prayers unheard, steering in the rough current proves impossible. The little boat is last seen careening towards the sinister cones it sought to avoid. 'The terrible loss of life shall remain with me all my days,' says a devastated officer.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800364</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is horrifying that most significant members of the crew&lt;/b&gt; are aboard this fragile dinghy. Of course one would not wish a mine to explode any loyal man, but when it bellows up below a collection of your finest, death stings all the more. The crew are understandably devastated at the destruction they have witnessed first-hand. Life feels as if it may never be the same again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800360</GUID><Text>Tell them to stay on the ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800365</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your faith goes untried&lt;/b&gt; in the nervous silence, as the ship escapes the mine trap the same way it entered. All agree they should never have ended up in a minefield in the first place.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800366</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your faith does not go untried.&lt;/b&gt; The sinister cones have moved about over time, and no matter how truly the ship follows its original course, it is inevitable a mine will burst into the hull. Luckily when the blast comes, no man dies. Still, the burdensome schedule of repair disheartens the crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800367</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;None of it is of any use.&lt;/b&gt; Your godforsaken crew do not realise how the sinister cones move about over time. No matter how true the course, more than one mine shakes the ship's belly as it limps clear. Many lives are lost, and the damage to the ship is severe.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800575</GUID><Text>Lost in the Desert</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800576</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The map of these endless dunes is a swindle.&lt;/b&gt; The first officer turns to berate the guide from whom they were purchased, but the fellow is already gone, as if the sands had swallowed him up. A solitary well offers a slight dribble of consolation, but your men must otherwise come to terms with being rather lost.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800577</GUID><Text>Use a reflective object to signal help</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800581</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A local rider comes to the rescue.&lt;/b&gt; He saunters over on his camel, and explains the well is part of a lost city, accessible over a small rise. The crew are enchanted by the grand quarry, swept over by the sands of time, observations of which shall no doubt bring them fame on their return. After proof of their remarkable discovery has been gathered, the rider is only too glad to lead the elated crew back to more familiar dunes.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800578</GUID><Text>Navigate by the stars</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800582</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Clear desert nights are perfect for astronomers.&lt;/b&gt; Beneath a black cloak lucid with the constellations, your expert navigators school the remainder in mankind's relation to the heavenly bodies. It is a moment of realisation for many. Enlightened, the crew return to the ship filled with the wonder of the desert and their place in the universe.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800583</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Something of a path appears&lt;/b&gt;, though as much by luck as star-gazing. A little way along it, a silhouette crenellates the night - an imposing fortress. Too tired for trouble, you wonder if it is worth knocking at the grand door.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800586</GUID><Text>Ask at the fort for help</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800588</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The occupant Sultan welcomes you in.&lt;/b&gt; He introduces himself in his own tongue, and is impressed by your interpreters. "You are far from what you seek. Stay, replenish for the journey ahead." Thus the crew enjoy the Sultan's hospitality while they can, for it will ease the last stretch of their journey.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800589</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You lack the means to communicate.&lt;/b&gt; Believing you to be an invasion force, the paranoid Sultan orders hot oil be poured from the ramparts. There is no escaping for one, eaten alive by the molten cascade. Resuming your desert path is the only option. The journey is a wearying lament for a fallen friend, meandering slowly back to civilisation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800587</GUID><Text>Ignore the fort and continue along the path</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800590</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is a long and draining journey.&lt;/b&gt; Finally the crew limp exhausted into a settlement, from where it will no doubt be possible to procure the appropriate charts. Most would be happy never to see those grumpy old camels ever again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800584</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The "stars are fickle", say your officers by way of excuse.&lt;/b&gt; After traveling for a while, the familiar shape of the well appears in the darkness. Your men have been walking in a circle.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800585</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The stars utterly perplex your party.&lt;/b&gt; With romantic notions dashed, the crew look around for some landmark, but instead find a featureless wasteland. They are desperately lost. Water, food and hope are in increasingly short supply. But even in a desert, there must be a way...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800591</GUID><Text>Follow the local wildlife</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800594</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Desperate thanks are due to a dung beetle.&lt;/b&gt; As it scuttles along, those less capable in coleopterology cast doubt on the value of pursuing it. There is a minor scuffle in the sand before at last the bloody-nosed experts are listened to. The jolly beetle leads to owl dung, and owls in turn to farmland. Thus the embittered and exhausted crew are saved from desiccation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800595</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A wild goose chase to desolation.&lt;/b&gt; Though the ostrich your crew have found cannot fly, it lollops along at surprisingly high speed. They try in vain to follow, but the sun is twice its usual size, and the bird is gone. Hot sand melts soles, and feet begin to swell. The water is out. Those that make it must have some evolutionary adaptation, because for most the desert is to be their graveyard.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800592</GUID><Text>Divine for Water</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800596</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your reprobates have no knowledge of desert mysteries.&lt;/b&gt; The divining rod has wasted enough of your time, and your caravan is nearly through the water.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800597</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A pretty price for divine mercy.&lt;/b&gt; The Y-shaped stick leads all on a meandering path. One insists on stopping to dig, and is left behind. It is a wasted, and fatal effort. After two days of hardship, the rest stumble over a crest to discover the wide blue sea, their mocking ship upon it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800593</GUID><Text>Move bravely on</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800598</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sun is unspeakably hot.&lt;/b&gt; As the bedraggled lumber back to civilisation, there are wiltings among them. It is too much for the others to turn their heads. Bodies slumping to ash and dust, lost to the waves of a powder sea.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800579</GUID><Text>Wait for a sign of the true path</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800599</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Star of wonder, star of light!&lt;/b&gt; Your wise magi are stirred by an unusually bright celestial body, that is surely a sign! It foretells a spiritual pilgrimage through the desert leading to a Garden of Eden. A grove of flowing streams, orange and incense, where like-minded devotees congregate. Your crew feel blessed, and the expedition can resume with new-found devotion.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800600</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Are the gods testing you?&lt;/b&gt; You wait and wait but there is not yet a sign.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800601</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The omen is a ravaging howl.&lt;/b&gt; "Water in the desert?! it's coming from everywhere!" Already up to their necks in strong current, the weak swimmers flounder like ants in a bathtub. Those that do not drown must wait until morning to look upon the aftermath. "A flood from heaven, to punish the wicked," say the survivors, as they trudge back to civilisation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800580</GUID><Text>Walk stubbornly in one direction</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800602</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You are extremely lucky to survive.&lt;/b&gt; The crew whinge and whine the whole way about scattergun strategy. After a day without shade, a fight even breaks out. But sticking to the fixed heading eventually leads, not before time, back to some kind of reality.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800603</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your expedition boils.&lt;/b&gt; Further and further it goes, into the desert's incandescent interior. Each soul more and more convinced that redemption is over the next dune. But it is not. Three days later, the party might have felt relief at the sight of a caravan, but instead end up wishing they had died with their comrades.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801642</GUID><Text>Scylla and Charybdis</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801643</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew attempts the crossing of a vicious strait.&lt;/b&gt; Like Odysseus along the coasts of Sicily, they see a subsidiary current running counter to the main flow, its strength so wild it brings fish with deformed eyes and luminescent bellies to the surface. What creatures are not swallowed by this whirlpool end up impaled on the shore's nasty teeth.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801646</GUID><Text>Avoid the whirlpool and maneuver to dodge the shore</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801648</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Odysseus didn't have the ability of your navigators.&lt;/b&gt; Through a series of tight maneuvers and expert understanding of the furious currents, they drive the ship between the whirlpool and the shore, using the provided momentum to dash ahead. The moment is a brief as it is intense and the crew rejoices, laughing like children under the cold droplets of crashing waves.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801649</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The maneuver is even more complicated than expected.&lt;/b&gt; The ship is driven alongside the whirlpool and flirts with the shore, the racket of the water covering the orders shouted by officers. The current speeds up, inexorably pulling the ship towards the reef.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801651</GUID><Text>Spin the ship to take the damage on its flank</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801653</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A frontal crash is avoided, but it is a crash nonetheless.&lt;/b&gt; The whole ship protests against the unnatural movement, its rudder straining against the current and its hull complaining loudly against the maneuver until the impact silences it. The repairs are much lighter than they could have been.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801654</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your navigators cannot control the wild ship.&lt;/b&gt; The maneuver sends it spinning and it plunges into the reef prow first. If it weren't for the metal cast protecting the vessel, the crew would have been crushed as well. The repairs, which take place both in the swirling waters and on the knife-like rocks, are excruciating.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801652</GUID><Text>Bombard the shore in an attempt to slow the ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801655</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Power faces power in a risky but successful attempt.&lt;/b&gt; All cannons are fired in the shore's direction, in a surprisingly efficient effort to slow the ship down. The ship lands on the devastated coast and the hull is barely grated by the remains of the broken stone spears.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801656</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What did they expect, attacking nature itself?&lt;/b&gt; The massive teeth of stone barely tremble under the cannon's fire, and the recoil is a futile strength against the voracious current. The rock jaw catches the ship and grinds the upper deck, sending several sailors to be served as the strait's daily food.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801650</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Fear clouds the navigators' readings.&lt;/b&gt; Unable to choose between several possible courses which could all end in disaster, they opt for a stunned silence and let the crew maneuver on their own. The ship crashes on the shore in an explosion of metal and wood which sends a dozen men overboard and straight into the rock fangs of the coast. It is more a wreck than a ship which escapes the deadly strait.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801647</GUID><Text>Avoid the shore and hope the whirlpool won't suck the ship in</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801657</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors' fright gives them wings.&lt;/b&gt; The crew reacts to each order with unparalleled speed, too occupied to plead the heavens to think of discussing the risky manoeuvres that are asked of them. When at last the whirlpool is passed, their belief that the Almighty might have his eyes on this ship is stronger than ever.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801658</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There are only so many disasters faith can prevent.&lt;/b&gt; When they understand that the whirlpool is a monster none should face, the sailors fall to their knees to pray and beg, abandoning what meaningless impact they could have had on the ship's trajectory. Like Circe prophesied to Odysseus, the currents attack the ship, the men, and a hero.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802115</GUID><Text>Lava Maze</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802116</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Tremors, ash rain, light during night: it's an eruption!&lt;/b&gt; The island was too lush and bountiful to be harmless. The lava responsible for the fertile ground creeps from the mouth of the waking volcano and towards the jungle where a party of your men had erected camp for the night.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802117</GUID><Text>Go back to the ship despite the darkness</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802119</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ship is quickly found.&lt;/b&gt; The burning lights of the volcano illuminate the jungle and a handful of seasoned explorers lead the rest of the sailors back to the ship, zigzagging between shadows and fleeing animals. The vessel departs as the island is engulfed in flames, a vision as terrible as it is magnificent.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802120</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors are swallowed by the jungle's maze.&lt;/b&gt; Dense trees, moving shadows, screeching animals and the crew itself, whose silhouettes are deformed by the scorching heat. Too many visions allow panic to spread among the men, who cannot recognize the path and never make it back to the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802118</GUID><Text>Find shelter against the incoming lava</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802121</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Shelter!&lt;/b&gt; The crew finds a decrepit stone chapel, remains of a colonialist power, and deems it a better refuge than their cloth-made tents. An officer estimates that the lava will be on them soon: there's no choice but to spend the night here.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802125</GUID><Text>Pray for the chapel to hold</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802127</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The chapel miraculously stands its ground.&lt;/b&gt; Lava rolls against its walls and forks around the white stone, melting its paint and parching its plaster. Nested on the only facade left untouched by the flow, the chapel's wooden door seems like the most fragile object the sailors have ever seen. When day comes they are safe and elated, and all kiss the blessed door before leaving.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802128</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Their faith is nothing but hypocrisy in need.&lt;/b&gt; The crew remembers old aves from their worshipping days, but the years have eroded both their memory and their beliefs. They can only watch as the lava packs against the chapel's stained glass and breaks through. The spray of molten stone and broken glass scars all of them but kills none: a bite to remind them of their lack of dedication.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802126</GUID><Text>Dig trenches in the holy ground</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802129</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The trenches are dug with military efficiency.&lt;/b&gt; Despite the darkness and the imminent danger, the sailors manage to dig deep trenches in no time and the pits redirect the lava as it flows in. The sailors snuggle in the chapel while lava runs around them, illuminating the stained glass, and they rejoice in the warm comfort of their shelter.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802130</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Too much pressure and too little grit.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors can dig little more than scattered and knee-deep pits which have a negligible impact on the lava's course. As the crew scurries inside the chapel, so does the lava enters the sacred place and hugs the walls, its smoke burning throats and forever robbing the men of their voices.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802122</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew is lost and perplexed.&lt;/b&gt; Your most committed explorers cannot wrap their heads around the complexity of the jungle, which changes with every new burnt tree, and it seems that every uncovered path might end in lava-devoured dead ends.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802131</GUID><Text>Follow a random animal and trust its instincts</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802133</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;All animals run to the beach, and your crew follows.&lt;/b&gt; Tracking down the herd of squealing, screeching, shrilling critters could be done with eyes closed and the sailors are led to the shore where they had beached. The ship departs in a hurry, leaving the animals to die into the ruthless volcano fire.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802134</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your hunters find no pattern in the animals' frenzy.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors run in a display of panic and poor judgment, mimicking the animals' despaired behavior. The crew still on the ship can only watch in horror as the island's greatest predator burns all preys, be they beast or human.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802132</GUID><Text>Pick a random path and trust your instincts</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802135</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Fear is the most reliable instinct.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors scamper through the jungle, chasing after their lava-created shadows. They stumble upon the beach by pure miracle and hop on the ship with the molten tongues on their heels, and the ship departs with a slightly charred hull but a safe crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802136</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Fear is a treacherous adviser.&lt;/b&gt; Seeing that the only unburnt path is up, the sailors climb the jungle's trees in an attempt to escape the lava flow. Ground, then bark, then branches, then humans: everything burns. In the distance, the ship's remaining crew stay transfixed as they witness the volcano island devouring itself.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802138</GUID><Text>Selfless Deeds</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802139</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"They steal your children?"&lt;/b&gt; The air hangs heavy around the sailors as their question withers in the hut. Their hosts consider the explorers, half-hopeful, half-eaten with the certitude that non-paying jobs are not the ones your crew enjoys. One child has to be offered with each new moon, an elder explains as she gestures towards the nearby river, or else bandits raid the surrounding settlements. Tomorrow, the bandits' steamboat will come to claim this village's due.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802140</GUID><Text>Board the bandits' steamer with your gunboat</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802144</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your assault is swift and without a single casualty.&lt;/b&gt; The kidnappers oppose no resistance when their carcass of a craft faces your own fresh-from-the-factory gunboat. They reluctantly lead you to their hideout, a sweatshop with no other employees than the stolen kids. Your crew sets the hideout afire, heads back to the village, and returns the children to their exulting parents: they give no rewards but smiles and tears, and your crew basks in this priceless payment.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802141</GUID><Text>Shadow the kidnappers back to their hideout with a river skiff</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802145</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew navigates through the mangrove with aplomb.&lt;/b&gt; The unusual environment doesn't manage to stop their steady rowing, and the sailors soon reach an outpost marking the entrance of the bandits' camp. Sobbing children are taken out of the kidnappers' steamboat and dragged towards a distant barn. Half a dozen armed men guard the building.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802148</GUID><Text>Attack the bandits before they reach the barn</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802150</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The bandits don't know what hit them.&lt;/b&gt; Using the element of surprise to their advantage, your sailors break into the camp and stifle the children's escorts before they can call for help. They hush the kids and squat behind what few bushes offer protection, monitoring the other bandits. The attack wasn't noticed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802152</GUID><Text>Go all out on the bandits and save the remaining children</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802154</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Sailors and kids create a breathtaking chaos.&lt;/b&gt; The crew shoots and skewers while the children kick and bite their former oppressors, calling others to do the same. A deluge of shrieking kids and young adults emerges from the barn and attacks the guards, thrilled by your crew's display of strength. The band of unlikely fighters seize the bandits' steamboat, help themselves to their supplies, and triumphantly returns to the coast.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802155</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Audacity does not make up for their lack of numbers.&lt;/b&gt; The crew manages to take down five guards before the noise attracts more armed bandits, and the sailors are driven back to their boat without a chance to liberate more children. The flee to the village and share what information they can with the villagers, glad to have freed some kids but aware that many more are still captive.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802153</GUID><Text>Acknowledge the danger and leave with what children are already saved</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802156</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The decision to run is not a simple one.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors recognize how dangerous the assault could be and retreat to the village with the few children they have saved. They share what information they can with the villagers - maybe another day, with a subtler approach, more men, more planning... As the ship leaves the crew focuses on the good they did, rather than the deeds they could have done.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802151</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors are unfit for a swift assault.&lt;/b&gt; Their choreographed clumsiness and dissonant roars drive the opponents back not because of their strength but because of the unconventional display. After an instant of bafflement, the kidnappers shout for others to join them and the whole gang soon surrounds your crew. They part to let their leader, a beast of a man, face the puny intruders.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802157</GUID><Text>Fight the brute</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802159</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors' cause fuels their victory.&lt;/b&gt; Driven by their will to save the children, your sailors do not waver in front of the bandits' leader, all muscles and swords and wild eyes. It takes six fighters to face the man, piling up on him in a torrent of dust and groans until he finally stops rampaging. Disheartened by this defeat and their leader's meaningless pride, the remaining kidnappers are brought to their knees and the children are freed. The crew returns to the village triumphant!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802160</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The mastodon tramples your sailors.&lt;/b&gt; The rescuers lack resistance and they are wiped by the bandits' leader, their corpses sent flying among the children who can do nothing but watch in horror. In a ultimate act of hatred, a young girl is sent back to her village to retell the carnage and warn future intruders against trying to rescue the children again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802158</GUID><Text>Run away</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802161</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No sailor harmed, no child saved.&lt;/b&gt; The crew manages to run back to the village, avoiding the multiple gunshots fired by the kidnappers. That no sailor was wounded is a miracle, but it pales when your rescue team comes back with no rescued child.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802149</GUID><Text>Hide between the tree and wait for nightfall</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802162</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew merges with the trees.&lt;/b&gt; Unseen, unheard, the sailors bury themselves in the forest and observe their future targets. An opportunity arises when a group of bandits leave their posts to bathe in the river: splashing and talking, they do not hear your men approach.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802164</GUID><Text>Steal their clothes to disguise as bandits</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802166</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors in disguise orchestrate the children's escape.&lt;/b&gt; Dressed with the bandits' rough coats and sashes, the crew infiltrates the barn turned sweat shop where children are forced to work. One by one they lead the kids out of the camp and into their skiff, each child carrying stolen supplies: when the boat finally leaves, the camp is left without fuel, food, or ammunitions. It will be some time before the bandits can do any more harm.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802167</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The poorly-disguised intruders are identified and given chase.&lt;/b&gt; When asked by an actual bandit about their shift, one of your undercover sailors tries to answer: they fumble and bumble until the bandit grabs them and shouts for intruders. They make a run for it with the others, leaving both kidnappers and children behind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802165</GUID><Text>Capture the men to use them as hostages</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802168</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A flawless action, from start to finish.&lt;/b&gt; After a swift capture of the naked bandits, the sailors advance and discover the camp's true nature: a children-powered sweatshop. It is soon obvious that the bandits' leader is the only one who does not care for the hostages, and the man is forcibly exchanged by his crew against the promise that your sailors will never set foot here again. The rescuers come back with children on their shoulders, a culprit to be judged, and goods to be shared.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802169</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The naked men overpower your fighters.&lt;/b&gt; The element of surprise does not compensate the lacking strength of the crew, and they are easily repelled by the bathing bandits. Instead of killing them, the kidnappers order the sailors to strip and send them back as is, rescuers unable to retrieve the children and humiliated in the process.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802163</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors are not attuned to the notion of stealth.&lt;/b&gt; They argue about the best place to hide and end up lining behind what could be the thinnest trees of the forest, their racket and bulging shapes attracting the undivided attention of the kidnapers. Their leader, more beast than man, advances to inspect the intruders and laughs at the puny men.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802170</GUID><Text>Face the brute</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802172</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew is puny indeed, and it is butchered.&lt;/b&gt; The bandits' leader needs no help to fight your rescuers, who spend more time trying to avoid being hit than actually fighting back. They flee the camp, scatter into the woods, and are hunted down like game. The few sailors who make it back to the coast can't even determinate the location of the kidnappers' camp, making the deaths of their companions pointless.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802146</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The terrain is not one your crew is used to.&lt;/b&gt; They get stuck in the mangrove roots and their swearing can be heard all the way to the coast. When they manage to get free, the bandits' steamboat is waiting, its railings lined with guns.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802173</GUID><Text>Bluff and pretend backup is on its way</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802176</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your bluff works!&lt;/b&gt; The kidnappers have a heated discussion before handing over what few children they have onboard, pressed by the menace your crew just invented. The sailors retreat to the village and deliver the kids, still amazed by their performance but upset they could save so little.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802177</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They do not buy your bluff.&lt;/b&gt; Holding your crew at gunpoint, the bandits casually wait for the reinforcements to show up. They don't. To teach your crew a lesson, the kidnappers grab one of the kids onboard and cut his tongue before throwing it into your raft: a lesson for liars. Your sailors withdraw to the village, convinced they made things worse.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802174</GUID><Text>Attempt to buy the children</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802178</GUID><Text>The kidnappers smirk.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802179</GUID><Text>Okay</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802181</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A pricey but worthy trade.&lt;/b&gt; Trying to hide their distaste for treating children like goods, your sailors bring the kids onboard. They are in a state of shock but look physically sound.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802183</GUID><Text>The children are safe with you, punish their abductors</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802186</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your retribution is ruthless.&lt;/b&gt; The kidnappers are still counting the goods you bought the children with when the crew attacks, and its assault is brutal. The steamboat is set aflame and all bandits die by fire or bullet. The crew brings the kids back to the safety of their homes, but the children now see them as no different from their captors: beasts driven by violent instincts.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802187</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors are overpowered.&lt;/b&gt; The kidnappers have fought much harder battles against much less men, and your crew's attack is dismissed with scorn. They could easily have retrieved the children, but their strange sense of honor makes them consider that goods bought are goods acquired. The crew is sent back to the village with the kids, both looking equally dishevelled and aghast.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802184</GUID><Text>The children will be safer with their parents, let the kidnappers leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802188</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Pity to let the culprits escape so easily.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors bring the children back to their respective families, but the kids' joy fails to hide how many more could have been saved given an extra effort.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802180</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802189</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You do not match the bandits' expectations.&lt;/b&gt; To teach your crew a lesson, the kidnappers grab one of the kids onboard and cut his thumb before throwing it into your raft: a lesson for the penniless. Your sailors withdraw to the village, convinced they made things worse.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802175</GUID><Text>Let them be and leave</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802190</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's only so much your sailors can do.&lt;/b&gt; They back away under the menace of the bandits' guns, doing their best not to trigger an attack, and row back to the coast. The parents of the abducted children thank them for the effort, but their strangled hopes make their voices break. The sailors leave knowing they could have done better.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802147</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Rather than bandits, the crew finds their leftovers.&lt;/b&gt; The bayou's fog makes for a maze your sailors cannot navigate and they lose the bandits. They stumble upon both less and more than what they expected: a pit filled with torn shoes and their torn makers. The image stays with them until they try to describe it to the villagers and break down, unable to depict the young faces and their blank eyes. They leave, disgusted by their inability to end this savagery.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802142</GUID><Text>Stay on your ship and deploy fire when the steamboat appears</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802191</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A masterful shot!&lt;/b&gt; Using one of your precious spiral-muzzled cannons, the crew fires a single shot which pierces straight through the steamboat's engines. The boat gradually stops puffing and drifts to your own ship, where sailors can pluck the bandits and three stolen children.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802194</GUID><Text>Scare the kidnappers into revealing the position of their hideout</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802197</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your seafarers coerce the river-dwellers into saying the truth.&lt;/b&gt; There is a world of knowledge and pain into your men's eyes, and the bandits are overwhelmed by their presence before a single word is spoken. The revealed hideout is an easy prey for your crew, which storms through the den and triumphantly bring all children back to their parents, along with the bandits' possessions and supplies.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802198</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The intention is here, but not the result.&lt;/b&gt; The bandits recognize your sailors for what they are: sharp-shooters indeed, but weaklings when it comes to close-range confrontation. The crew's threats are nothing to them. Knowing that these men know where the rest of the children are held, your crew hands them to the villagers along with the kids they found, and leave with a feeling of defeat.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802196</GUID><Text>Enough risks for today: return the children and be on your way</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802199</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Thoughts of the remaining captives follow your crew.&lt;/b&gt; The villagers are thrilled to have the handful of children returned to them and profusely thank their saviors, making their remorse worse with each new praise. The sailors are happy for them but know they could have done more.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802192</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Poor use of your firepower.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors handling the cannons and the weapons themselves are equally important: not as well-oiled as the machinery, the crew fails to adjust the quantity of powder used, firing the artillery to its maximum range without any kind of aiming. They might as well have lit signal fires. The bandits' boat makes a brutal turn and retreats in the bayou at full speed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802201</GUID><Text>Shadow the kidnappers back to their hideout with a river skiff</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802193</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Both bandits and captives are killed.&lt;/b&gt; The villagers watch in horror as your ship fires its cannons at the small steamboat as soon as it is in sight, annihilating the frail vessel and all life onboard. Mothers and fathers rush in the water, screaming and crying as tiny bodies slowly emerge. If your crew had had a greater control over themselves and the ship, maybe they wouldn't have had to bear the weight of these children's deaths.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802143</GUID><Text>Ignore the bandits and go on your way</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802200</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Not all sailors share your lack of compassion.&lt;/b&gt; Some men and women refuse to leave and the officers have no choice but to let them do as they please lest they'd lose even more of the crew's trust. Many sailors argue that staying to help was the right choice, but the ship has already set sail when they voice their opinion.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802228</GUID><Text>The Deeper You Go</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802229</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Boulder-blocked entrance and booby-trapped corridor: typical Mayan temple.&lt;/b&gt; After a fall down a slide and a crash into uncharted caves, your team of explorers jokes about the situation to forget its deathly aspect. They know what is said of Mayan mazes: the deeper you go, the shinier it gets.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802230</GUID><Text>Follow the suggested route and progress through the traps</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802232</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The obvious traps are easily evaded.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors contort themselves to avoid sharp stones and plated triggers, flowing through the corridor with the ease of seasoned explorers, or cutpurses. They quickly reach the pocket of the temple: a vast chasm crossed by a meager bridge with no handrails. Could this be a trial of courage?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802233</GUID><Text>Cross the run-down bridge</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802234</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The trial is passed!&lt;/b&gt; As they swing their arms to keep their balance, your sailors hit ropes suspended around the bridge, hidden by a clever camouflage of paint and shadow play. They grasp the ropes to steady their footing and a distant mechanism clicks. A rumbling door opens on the other side of the chasm, revealing the exit and, on its threshold, a shiny artifact.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802235</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Nothing rewards your sailors' recklessness.&lt;/b&gt; It is unclear whether the bridge is shaking because of its own frailty or because of your explorers' quivering legs. Soon the crew is on its knees, creeping across the moldy planks and begging for their mothers. They reach the other side without a scratch save for their wounded pride and find a tunnel which leads them outside after some more crawling.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802236</GUID><Text>Climb down the chasm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802237</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The climb is child's play.&lt;/b&gt; Rock walls provide a much steadier footing than wind-flogged masts. The sailors reach the bottom of the chasm, where they find an army of ropes stretching into the darkness above: the entrails of the temple's mechanisms! They find what might have been the Mayan engineers' entrance and leave the temple with filled pockets and memories.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802238</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The effort is above the crew's strength.&lt;/b&gt; An officer loses her nerve and her grip, slips down the stone, and a soft thud welcomes her fall. Smooth slithering sounds hush her desperate cries. The floor is covered in snakes!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802239</GUID><Text>Find a way among the snakes</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802241</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors manage to flee.&lt;/b&gt; Too occupied by the convulsing mass of the fallen officer, the reptiles do not notice the furtive crew as it tip toes past them and escapes through the first tunnel available. The explorers emerge outside of the temple, stunned by their survival.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802242</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They cannot read the snakes' behaviour.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors progress among the wriggling floor, so focused on their movements they do not see the mass of snakes backing away from them and piling against the sole exit. The crew has no choice but to run into the tunnel before it is filled with snakes, and several sailors end up as reptile diner.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802240</GUID><Text>Scare the snakes away with torches</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802243</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew stands its ground as well as it can.&lt;/b&gt; The burning torches are swung before the snakes, forcing them back from both sailors and prey. The officer is pulled to her feet and dragged with the rest of the crew through a windy tunnel which leads them outside, empty-handed but safe.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802244</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What should the snakes be scared of, exactly?&lt;/b&gt; Your crew flaps the torches around them in a ballet of shaking hands and dripping sweat, and they cannot even make one step forward that a young sailor waves his torch past the limits of safety. The snakes leap on your crew, leaving none but a single witness alive.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802245</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The challenge demands more coordination than the crew has.&lt;/b&gt; Surprised by the brushing elbow of a comrade, a sailor squeals in terror and jumps back, triggering trap after trap of flying arrows, flaming oils, poison sprays. Once the most sensational traps have simmered down, the roof collapses and seals the exit. Sand slowly starts to fall from the walls.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802246</GUID><Text>Look for a possible hidden mechanism</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802249</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The patterns of the mechanism do not escape your hunters' probing.&lt;/b&gt; Upon close and cool-headed inspection, one the sand-spewing hourglass engravings appears to be protruding from the wall. The sailors smash the button, forcing the wall to open and reveal an exit. They immediately run away from the sand and the temple itself.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802250</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;If there is a mechanism, they do not find it.&lt;/b&gt; Sand keeps pouring into the room, ricocheting off the sailors, blinding them, forcing its way into their noses and mouth. The explorers utter muted screams. As the sand packs against the walls, one of them crumbles under the weight and lets the sailors spill outside of the temple: some alive, most dead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802248</GUID><Text>Break a possibly weak wall</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802251</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The old wall caves in effortlessly.&lt;/b&gt; Following the sand-pouring cracks, the explorers identify the wall from which most grains seem to be coming. They stave it in, causing a dusty outpour which fills their lungs then clears to reveal sunlight. They hasten through the self-made exit and end up on the beach where they had left the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802252</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The explorers bang on the walls helplessly.&lt;/b&gt; Sand keeps pouring into the room, ricocheting off the sailors, blinding them, forcing its way into their noses and mouth. The crew utters muted screams. As the sand packs against the walls, one of them crumbles under the weight and lets the sailors spill outside of the temple: some alive, most dead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802231</GUID><Text>Create your own path and push the boulder away</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802253</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The boulder moves!&lt;/b&gt; The combined efforts of the crew manage to lift the giant stone out of its socket. As the boulder rolls, a loud snap resonates and the rock bounces back in place. A wall falls behind the sailors and, in a concert of grating dirt and destroyed stone, it starts to advance towards the crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802255</GUID><Text>Push against the wall to stop it</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802257</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ancient wall cannot resist your crew's pressure.&lt;/b&gt; They grunt in unison and breathe in rhythm with their effort. One, two. The wall stops in its tracks. One. It shivers. Two. The wall crumbles, revealing a large opening under its railings: the crew finds the body of a less lucky adventurer, one hand clawing at the threshold of a gaping exit, the other gripping an oversized diamond.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802258</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The wall is unfazed by your crew's efforts.&lt;/b&gt; As an explorer gets to her knees to pray in the face of imminent death, she notices an engraving much less elaborate than the temple's decorations: scribbled letters in a language she can actually understand! &lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Crawling by day, airborne by night."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Right underneath the scribbling are four buttons depicting animals.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802259</GUID><Text>Press the sloth</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802263</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Wrong answer.&lt;/b&gt; The brick above the pressed button opens and an arrow flies into the crew, perforating the throat of a sailor and leaving a red line in the cheek of the button-presser. The floor under the explorers tilts and they roll, a helpless mass of arms and legs which slides along the tunnel and is expelled outside the temple.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802260</GUID><Text>Press the bat</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802264</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Wrong answer.&lt;/b&gt; As she presses the button, the sailor feels no resistance and keeps pushing the carved stone until her full arm is into the wall. She can feel something furry on her skin, if a bit rough and a bit- She screams. As fangs dig into her flesh, a legion of bats emerge from the opened wall, forcing the sailors to retreat through their nest. The crew emerges from the temple covered in blood and crippled with a lasting fear of the dark.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802261</GUID><Text>Press the butterfly</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802265</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Right answer!&lt;/b&gt; The sailor hits the butterfly button and jubilates as the trap wall stops advancing and bricks whirl into the floor to shape a staircase. The crew emerges from the temple, wondering about the intentions of whoever had carved such needlessly complicated indications in their mother tongue.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802262</GUID><Text>Press the cockroach</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802266</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Wrong answer.&lt;/b&gt;As the cockroach is pressed, the insect shivers and shakes the dust off its shell. It's alive! The ceiling opens and a swarm of cockroaches flies into the room, aiming for the sailors' mouths. The crew smashes the insects with whatever object they have at hand and their horror gives them wings of their own, pushing them to climb the walls until they reach the outside.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802256</GUID><Text>Look for another way out</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802267</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The unfazed explorers rapidly find an exit.&lt;/b&gt; They notice how the floor's cobblestones move to let the advancing wall pass, and wait for the right moment to jump into the space between wall and floor. One by one they land into the room below, where a large opening to the outside lets morning light in and reveals a spectacle of spiderwebs surrounding a delicate piece of sculpted mahogany.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802268</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors do not find an exit.&lt;/b&gt; All stones look alike, and the crew lacks the ability to appraise which rock might be more important than the others. The advancing wall looms over, ready to crush their bones, when it suddenly leans forward and pushes the sailors to the floor, which in turn opens to eject the explorers outside the temple. They are alive, but the very sight of stone walls will scare them for years.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802254</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The boulder doesn't move.&lt;/b&gt; Your explorers push and nudge and thrust but the exit stays sealed. They have no choice but to obey the maze's invitation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802470</GUID><Text>The Storm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802472</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;This tempest is beyond anything you have ever faced.&lt;/b&gt; The smell of salt is everywhere. The freezing water pierces everyone. The winds and waves hit your ship with impossible violence, making the vessel groan and tremble with each new strike, the air so full of sea-spray one could drown in it. Is there anything mere humans could do in the face of such godlike wrath?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802474</GUID><Text>Pray that the usual method will work and reef the sails</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802478</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Trust in your habits pays.&lt;/b&gt; Years of executing the same maneuvers have ingrained them into your crew's instincts. The sailors reef sail after sail despite the poor visibility - they do not need sight, for they are guided by the invisible hand of practice. Only the fore and aft sails are left to flail in the wind to keep a semblance of control over the ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802481</GUID><Text>Sail through the storm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802483</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The vessel emerges from the storm, unscathed.&lt;/b&gt; The barren masts of your ship part the tempest as the crew maneuver its jib sails and the spanker, ridiculously small pieces of cloth in the face of the storm's fury. Still, the maneuver magnifies the importance of these sails and masterfully skirts the storm, leaving the curtain of rain just as lightning begins to strike. Entranced, the crew contemplates how they managed to defy such a grand power.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802484</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Waiting would have been a better option.&lt;/b&gt; If the force of training helped your crew while reefing the sails, it doesn't reveal how to navigate the furious tempest. Sailing with nothing but the jib sails and spanker is a feat no one on your ship is capable of. The vessel is tossed about helplessly until the storm decides to calm down.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802482</GUID><Text>Wait for the storm to pass</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802543</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The storm passes.&lt;/b&gt; With the sails reefed to avoid damage, the sailors have only themselves to care about: they bury under the deck in wet bundles, shivering under the biting cold of the unremitting downpour. The endless wait is dispelled by a timid sun, and the expedition can finally resume.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802479</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What is faith in yourself against the rage of the heavens?&lt;/b&gt; The sails trash against their mast, escaping the hands of your sailors as they desperately try to reef them. The freezing rain becomes hail, and the crew's strength melts under the relentless pounding. About half the sails are secured when lightning booms in the distance.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802486</GUID><Text>Order the crew to finish reefing the sails</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802488</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Just in time!&lt;/b&gt; The lieutenants' preaching hits the sailors harder than the hail itself, and the crew pours their last drops of effort into reefing the remaining sail. As they finish attaching the spanker, the full strength of the tempest hits the ship. To the relief of the crew the reefed sails take no damage, but the ship lurches helplessly, carried by the whims of the storm until it finally calms down.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802489</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's no courage in these cowards.&lt;/b&gt; Despite the repeated calls of the lieutenants and the emergency of the situation, the sailors stay frozen in the face of the thunderstorm, awed mice before a famished cat.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802490</GUID><Text>The distant storm or your immediate flogging: their choice</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802492</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The threat works.&lt;/b&gt; The perspective of a flogging somewhat outweighs the menace of the thunderstorm, and the sailors resume their work in a panic. The sails are reefed and secured right before the heart of the storm crashes into your ship. Letting the tempest haul you through the ocean is not a pleasant experience, but at least the sailboat didn't take any damage.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802493</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The threat is not only weak, but unwarranted.&lt;/b&gt; Distraught by the storm and unable to gather their wits, your lieutenants cannot catch the crew's attaention. The sailors are too immersed in saving their individual lives to mind orders, and even moreso when they are given without conviction. Your ship is swallowed by the tempest, chewed and grinded and spat. Its skeletal remains drift away from the storm.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802491</GUID><Text>None other than the Lord can choose our path now</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802496</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your prayers are heard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;"A thousand may fall at your side, &lt;/br&gt;Ten thousand at your right hand, &lt;/br&gt;But it will not come near you. &lt;/br&gt;You will only observe with your eyes &lt;/br&gt;And see the punishment of the wicked."&lt;/br&gt;As your priest intones, perched atop the bow, so does the storm seem to soften. A miracle? When the skies clear, however, it would appear that some sailors were judged to be wicked.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802497</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The thunderstorm hits your ship with full force.&lt;/b&gt; Call it divine punition or pure coincidence, but the tempest gathers around the vessel and hell begins. Lightning strikes the masts and tears through the sails, igniting brief fires that are immediately doused by the hail. The deck is water, the ship is a wave - and it crashes against the sea, again and again. When at least sunrays bless the sailboat, its shape is torn and mangled.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802487</GUID><Text>Maneuver with what sails you have left</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802498</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;To safety!&lt;/b&gt; Maneuvering with half the sails while facing oversized waves, pounding hail and incoming lightning is as difficult as it sounds. And yet the crew does it. Relying not on the sails, but on the ship's bilge keel and its keel-protecting apron, they spear through the wind without being driven sideways away from it. The boat leaps in the trough of waves, pushed by the raging force of the elements, offering the most resistance it can offer - until, at last, the tempest is left behind.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802499</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A close call.&lt;/b&gt; Navigating with so little sails proves more difficult than expected and the proximity of the thunderstorm makes the sea even wilder. The ship rolls among the gigantic waves, sailed more than it sails, and it is lifted and shifted by the whims of the tempest. The crew's maneuvers equal to choosing which less terrible wave they wish to crash into. When the storm recedes, the damage is somewhat acceptable.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802500</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Too slow.&lt;/b&gt; The crew's skills are limited to classic sailing, perhaps to sailing in a bit of bad weather, but not to storms of this magnitude. Not to a ship with half its sails reefed and the other half flailing in the gale. Ignoring the urgency of the freed sails, the sailors try to maneuver the ship and manage to present its full flank to the waves. The tempest gladly takes the offering. It hurls the ship into its midst, tears both sails and men from it, and spews the remains in calmer seas.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802475</GUID><Text>Frenzied measures for frenzied times: open all sails and ride the storm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802501</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Riding the wild wind isn't dangerous enough for your crew.&lt;/b&gt; In a display of utter complete control over the ship, they pull it to ride an invisible corridor of safe passage among the waves. What gale should have torn the sails apart fills them and makes the sailboat dance with a majesty at least as grand as the storm itself. Instead of leaving the tempest, the crew rides it until it calms down on its own, exhausted from carrying its new masters.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802502</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A move as wasteful as it was risky.&lt;/b&gt; Meek doesn't even begin to describe your sailors' ability: they deploy the sails in an incoherent manner, letting the wind take hold of the ship. The vessel yaws to one side, then to other, its rudder barely in contact with the water. A wave grabs a sailor and runs away with him. Any more of this and the whole crew will follow!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802503</GUID><Text>Time the anchor's release to counterbalance the ship</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802507</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A bold move!&lt;/b&gt; Releasing the anchor right as the ship reaches an upright position and begins to yaw again is the perfect timing to stop the chaotic rolling. The sailboat protests against the maneuver, trembling under the insistence of the waves, but obediently follows your crew's demands as they can finally steer it away from the storm. Unnerved but alive, the sailors agree that they have seen and done enough risk-taking for the day.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802508</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A move too bold.&lt;/b&gt; Timing the anchor's release to the yawing of the ship takes more competence and composure than your crew has: the iron cross is dropped as the ship rolls to the opposite side of the anchor's hawsehole and, instead of driving the ship back to a steady position, the anchor grinds against the flank and tears planks and railings as it falls. The waves do the rest. When the storm finally recedes, the ship is adrift, its flank gutted.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802504</GUID><Text>Fill the bottom of the hold to keep it steady</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802509</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Safe and sound.&lt;/b&gt; Ignoring the battering rain and navigating the pitching deck with skill, the sailors organize a human chain to store all upper decks goods in the depths of the ship. The temporary ballast, accompanied by the human weight of the sailors, manages to lower the waterline and quells the ship's rolls. Hidden in the hull and unable to do anymore for their ship, the crew must wait for the storm to calm down on its own.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802510</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Mayhem.&lt;/b&gt; Disheartened by the enormity of the task, the sailors hardly listen to their lieutenants. Four crew members attempt to follow orders and unfasten the deck's supplies, which roll away from them and swing through the deck as the ship continues to pitch, knocking down sailors and pushing them overboard, breaking the ship's railings and toppling its weakened masts. When the sun emerges, it reveals the emaciated silhouette of a ghost ship.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802476</GUID><Text>Use the steam engines to carefully follow the trough of waves</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802511</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Slow and steady.&lt;/b&gt;Maybe too slow? Careful maneuvers maintain your ship under favourable winds and keep the menace of transverse waves at bay, but the storm still rages and, worse, it keeps up with your pace.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802513</GUID><Text>Overheat the engines to outrun the storm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802515</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A power stronger than the elements themselves.&lt;/b&gt; Through skillful manipulation of the engines, the crew pushes the machinery to its utmost limit, the screw propeller moving beyond what human sight can perceive and propelling the steam ship with remarkable speed. The vessel breaks through the waves and away from the storm in a thrilling display of man-made might.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802516</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You should have been more patient.&lt;/b&gt; The crew cannot manage such a brusque change of pace, and their meager knowledge of the machinery is not enough to demand so much from the engines without paying an equivalent price. The ship vaults away from the storm in a cacophony of complaining metal and agonizing devices - when at least the tempest is gone, the engines require your immediate attention and repairs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802514</GUID><Text>Maintain a steady pace and let the storm push you off-tracks</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802544</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A negligible change of course.&lt;/b&gt; Letting the storm push your ship as it pleases upsets the most hot-headed sailors, but those with an actual brain upstairs appreciate the prudent approach. When the storm recedes, the ship's slight change of course takes a full week to be corrected - a decent trade-off for your safety.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802512</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You would have been better off with a windjammer.&lt;/b&gt; Navigating the ship through the storm proves trickier than expected, and the navigators' lack of familiarity with steam ships shows as they rely on the sails to maneuver, despite the ship's peculiar lack of a middle mast. It doesn't take long for the ship to protest against the poor handling. It yaws, and a loud rumble erupts from the hull: the ballast is unfastened!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802521</GUID><Text>Fasten the ballast back into place</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802523</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors are unperturbed by the pitching.&lt;/b&gt; They descend into the hull and avoid the rolling basalt stones with ease, tying the ballast back in place, stone by stone, knot by knot. They emerge bruised and exhausted, but the ship is now steady enough to wait for the storm to pass without any risk of broaching.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802524</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Too heavy, too dangerous.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors are ill-prepared to handle the massive basalt stones that act as ballast. They try to secure the stones in place but the ship continues to pitch and their footing is unsteady and the rocks are so, so heavy. A sudden yaw sends the basalt rolling into them and your sailors are knocked down and crushed like clay figures. There is nothing more to be done but wait for the ire of the tempest to pass.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802522</GUID><Text>Fight the pitching with a bold attempt at facing the wind</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802525</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Indeed, this is a windjammer.&lt;/b&gt; Navigating the steam ship like a good old sailboat, the navigators rely on the sails alone to steady the erratic movements, and strain the rudder to face a full frontal wind. This is fearless! The gale hits the wet sails with all its might, inflating them to their utmost limit, and the sudden force breaks the pitching. The navigators immediately seize the opportunity to restart the engines and escape the storm under the delighted clamor of the crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802526</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Disaster.&lt;/b&gt; Proving once more how unable they are to navigate the ship, the navigators attempt what should never be attempted: go against the wind. As the ship twirls the transversal gale strikes it with full force, transforming the yaw into a full-length broaching. The masts plunge into the sea, and there is no more up or down, no more sky or deck. Everything is water. When it drains away, allowing the ship to sway back into position, there is no trace left of the sailors taken by the storm.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802477</GUID><Text>Overwork the steam engines to boldly escape the storm</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802527</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A power stronger than the elements themselves.&lt;/b&gt; Through skillful manipulation of the engines, the crew pushes the machinery to its utmost limit, the screw propeller moving beyond what human sight can perceive and propelling the steam ship with remarkable speed. The vessel breaks through the waves and away from the storm in a thrilling display of man-made might.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802528</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The delicate machinery is handled brutishly.&lt;/b&gt; Assuming that the engines heat is directly proportional to the ship's speed, the engineer overheats the steamer and bring the boiler way over its capacity. The temperature rises and the pressure swells and the metal quivers, until one of the engine explodes, killing the engineer on the spot.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802529</GUID><Text>Attempt to use the remaining engine without your engineer</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802531</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An unexpected turnaround.&lt;/b&gt; A sailor steps forward: she's spent the trip observing the engineer, she says, and thinks she can handle the machinery. The lack of other volunteers, frightened by the engineer's death, leaves her as the only candidate. She handles the remaining engine with a notable if amateurish skill and the steam ship emerges from the storm in one piece. Still, several sailors whisper about the ill luck of letting a woman save them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802533</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;From bad to worse.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors have even less skill than the engineer who, let us insist on this point, died while trying to practise his specialty. The crew tries to push this thing and pull that other thing. The pieces of metal are kicked to the best of the crew's abilities until the air pump's valve bursts open, filling the entire room with burning steam and forcing the sailors outside. The valve must be closed, and a volunteer offers to face the miniature hell.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802534</GUID><Text>Forget engineering, and hope the Lord will protect the volunteer</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802537</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;If not skill, at least courage is rewarded.&lt;/b&gt; The volunteer rushes inside the engine room to close the leaking valve, screaming a Glory Be as the steam broils his skin. Both steam and storm recede once the valve is slammed closed, and the crew can take its time repairing the abused machinery. The volunteer spends the rest of the trip preaching the Lord's grace and his incessant sermon make the other sailors regret the tempest and its terrifying shrieks.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802538</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Hell indeed.&lt;/b&gt; Whether the volunteer lacked faith or the Lord lacked attention, it is only for Him to know. The man enters the engine room and can hardely touch the leaking valve before the steam devours him, large blisters feeding on his flesh while the whistling valve cover his sceams. There is no distinguishing the man's agony from the machinery's cries, and the door is hurriedly sealed shut. The inhumane shrieks continue to resound through the ship for the rest of the trip.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802536</GUID><Text>Insist on using your crafting wits, and protect him yourself</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802539</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The least bad of your worst.&lt;/b&gt; The volunteer penetrates the engine room wrapped in layers of wet cloths as the crew ventilates the room by quickly opening and closing its door, avoiding the steam with damp armors of their own. The man manages to close the valve and the rest of the steam is evacuated in the same ridiculously plain manner. The immediate danger is avoided, and the crew wisely decides to avoid any more risk-taking and wait for the storm to end on its own.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802540</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Don't you know when to stop?&lt;/b&gt; The sailor covers himself in damp cloths and enters the engine room, where the steam contaminates the wet protection with insufferable heat. He springs from the room covered in blisters, a monster of molten skin which howls agony beyond human comprehension, its outcry echoed by the tempest. The steam follows and burns all sailors within its grasp, taking delight in the stolen flesh until it finally recedes, replete thanks to the stubborness of the crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802530</GUID><Text>Shut off the engines and rely on your sails</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802541</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Audacious!&lt;/b&gt; Abandoning the steam engines, the crew focuses its efforts on using all sails available on the ship. The sailors have may not have faced tempests this grand before, but they have crossed seas and braved oceans aboard all kinds of vessels, and navigation is in their blood. The wind is faced and the waves ignored and the steering wheel locked into place, allowing the ship to stay steady until the storm passes. Not the most natural solution for a steam ship, but a good display of skill.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802542</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Reckless!&lt;/b&gt; Attempting to face the tempest without the ship's main power source is folly, and the crew cannot handle the safety sails as well as they imagined. They try to face the waves to break their momentum, but the ship's mishandling lets it drift and offers its flanks to the tempest. When the sun pierces the clouds, it reveals a spectacle of lacerated sails, flooded supplies, and disgruntled sailors.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802609</GUID><Text>The Mountain Maw</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802610</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors face the mountain without a map.&lt;/b&gt; After a race from guide to guide through the depths of the mountain range, the crew finds itself devoid of chaperon: the guide supposed to take them on this last trip didn't show up at the agreed time. Forget what initial goal the exploration followed. Getting out of the snow-whipped peak is the only priority.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802611</GUID><Text>Traverse the mountain on your own</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802613</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your navigators make do without a guide.&lt;/b&gt; They take note of landmarks as they progress, relying on their compasses to follow a straight direction, staying put during the night despite the dwindling supplies. At long last they find a stream of melted snow and follow it downhill to the feet of the mountain. The crew survived, but it was a tough effort.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802614</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A guide would have been helpful.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors navigate the mountain paths to the best of their ability, which is not enough. The narrow roads disappear under the snow mist and they branch around the skeletal trees, spreading your crew across their ramifications. When the explorers reach a decent camping ground and count their numbers, five of them are missing.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802618</GUID><Text>Go forward, leaving marks for the lost sailors to follow</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802620</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The feet of the mountain, at last.&lt;/b&gt; The crew progresses step by step, testing the frozen snow for gaps and leaving piles of stones for the lost sailors to follow. Building the landmarks takes time but it helps avoiding any backtracking. The main group is soon joined by the missing sailors, disgruntled to have been left behind despite the crew's efforts at guiding them, and they reach the end of the mountain range in silence, unable to express their relief.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802621</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The explorers get more lost with each passing day.&lt;/b&gt; They venture deep into the mountain and quickly abandon the idea of leaving marks for the lost sailors, too concerned for their own survival. The frost solidifies their clothes, steals their toes and rots their food.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802622</GUID><Text>Follow a stream of melted snow running downhill</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802625</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors manage to follow the stream to the mountain's feet.&lt;/b&gt; The stream flows in and out of the frozen ground, playing hide and seek with the desperate crew. They are not the only ones using the trickle as a guide: just before reaching the plains below the mountain, they meet with the missing sailors as they quell their burning thirst in the meagre snow stream. It's unclear which of the two teams is the most pitiful, but all are alive.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802626</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Where did they come from? Where should they go?&lt;/b&gt; The melting snow splits into a web of entangled streams which buries under the ground and resurfaces without any apparent logic. The crew is taken by the illusion that the forest around them is flat and can no longer tell if they are climbing or descending. They split like the streams themselves, to each sailor their trickle, and like the streams not all of them find the feet of the mountain.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802623</GUID><Text>Force your way through the mounds of powder snow</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802627</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors draw strength from their last resources.&lt;/b&gt; They ignore the colossal distance they have to cross and focus on small milestones instead. Two steps to that tree. Three steps to that rock. The snow parts as they advance, drawing dark trenches which run across the pure white mantle and reach the feet of the mountain. The crew stumbles and falls in relief when they realize they made it out alive.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802628</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors are too weakened by the cold.&lt;/b&gt; They dig through the powder snow which collapses on them without revealing any safe path. Their endurance crippled by the frost, they abandon the task and try to focus on less demanding options.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802624</GUID><Text>Prioritise your supplies and look for food</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802629</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The crew extends its stay in the cold to gather supplies.&lt;/b&gt; Game is scarce and hunting takes time. However, the food makes for a decent meal and the smell of roasted hare fills the sailors' stomachs almost as well as the meat itself. The cooking fire's lights spreads through the forest at night and beckons the missing sailors. Reunited, the crew avoids talking about abandoning their companions and they leave the mountain in silence.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802630</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your hunters fall prey to the mountain.&lt;/b&gt; Animals' tracks sprinkle the fresh snow, but their owners are invisible, hidden in holes and burrows. The hunters are unused to such terrain. As they progress through the forest, discussing where snares could be the most efficient, the frozen ground suddenly breaks under them and a handful of sailors dives into a deep fault.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802619</GUID><Text>Go back, and look for the missing sailors</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802631</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The missing sailors are found, and with them an exit.&lt;/b&gt; The idea of losing their companions pushes the hunters to persevere. Broken twigs, brushed moss, mud splashes: everything is a hint. They follow the trail to a crossing and find the lost sailors, who welcome them heartily: they have found a beaten path which leads straight to the feet of the mountain! That they believed in the others and waited for them is a reward in and of itself.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802632</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The fresh snow hides the dangers underneath.&lt;/b&gt; A powdery white covers everything in sight and the skies melt into the ground, hiding the horizon. The hunters advance on instinct, unable to look for hints of their previous passage. They find the missing sailors by encountering their fate: the frozen ground breaks under their weight. The thin crust of ice hid a fault! Three of the lost men are down there, and two hunters joined them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802633</GUID><Text>Pull the sailors from the fault, at the risk of falling</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802637</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The rescue comes at the price of their remaining strength.&lt;/b&gt; It takes ten sailors to get one man out of the fault: three to pull, six to hold and one to keep an eye on the trembling layer of ice. The snow weighs them down, pushing when they pull, hissing when they call out. When the last sailor is hauled from the rift, both rescuers and rescued are broken. They drag themselves downhill and manage to leave the clutch of the mountain.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802638</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ordeal is much bigger than your sailors.&lt;/b&gt; They launch ropes into the rift but the slippery walls of ice cannot be climbed. The rescuers attempt to haul the others up, and they plant their feet into the ground, pulling and pulling and panting, their physical reserves long drained by the cold. As they fall to their knees and break their nails on the frozen hemp, the rift cracks and the mountain opens its mouth wide. The swallowed crew is never seen again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802634</GUID><Text>Abandon them and continue downhill</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802639</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Salvation at the price of their humanity.&lt;/b&gt; Ignoring the begging screams of their companions, the sailors make a large detour to avoid falling into the frozen rift. As they find a beaten path heading downhill, a sailor catches up to the group, panting: he admits to having thrown pickaxes and ropes down the fault. The crew congratulates him for his selflessness, and they pretend the deed was enough to ease their conscience.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802612</GUID><Text>Go back on your tracks</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802640</GUID><Text>The Mountain Maw 1.2.1</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802642</GUID><Text>Blood, Oil, Tears and Sweat</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802643</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;An overweight ship is easy prey for stormy waves.&lt;/b&gt; The oil merchants your crew met at the last harbour paid good money for their cargo to be stored aboard your ship, but the weight isn't really something your vessel can handle. At the first signs of tempest winds and cutting waves, the unusual ballast makes your ship heel furiously.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802644</GUID><Text>Release the stern anchor to the sea floor</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802646</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Safe.&lt;/b&gt; The cast-iron shank of the anchor plunges into the shifting waves with a large splash, the amount of chain being just right for it to take a good hold of the sea floor. The ship wobbles, washed by the waves and winds, but manages to stay put. The sailors simply wait for the storm to pass and hope the extra load will not cause any more problems.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802647</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A miss - the crew should go hide in the lower decks.&lt;/b&gt; The anchor is released, its chain unravelling by itself more than it is controlled, and the large iron cross reaches the bottom with too much play to properly grip the sea floor. As it becomes apparent the anchor will not be of any help, the lieutenants order all to descend into the bottom of the swinging ship - but the oil merchants refuse to leave the apparent safety of their upper cabins.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802648</GUID><Text>Take the time to present this solution as the best</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802650</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The loss of time was necessary.&lt;/b&gt; Your lieutenants take the time to convince the merchants, detailing all available options one by one despite the increasingly high pressure from the waves and the rocking of the ship. Their stoicism more than their arguments convince the merchants of following orders, and they join the rest of the crew in the lower deck until the storm comes to pass.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802651</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A loss of time.&lt;/b&gt;Pressed by the emergency of the situation and unable to get their thoughts in order, your lieutenants cannot properly convince the merchants. As they begin to lose their nerve, the ship swerves and slams into the shore. Whistling winds invade the perforated hull and water seeps in their wake.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802652</GUID><Text>Repair the hole while the water is still pouring</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802654</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew is used to repairs in poor conditions.&lt;/b&gt; Ignoring the swinging floor, the sailors focus on the hull, their legs deep into the pouring water. Drenched supplies float and sink around them as they plug the hole. The seal will not last long, but it should hold until the next harbour.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802655</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew's speed cannot match the water's.&lt;/b&gt; Overwhelmed by the current and unable to prioritise their tasks or even shape a plan of the repairs, the sailors quickly abandon the idea of patching up the hull. They flee to the upper deck and brace themselves as the ship crashes on the shore, ripped apart. The repairs last for weeks.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802653</GUID><Text>Move the ballast to lift the hole above sea level</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802656</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The forced instability protects the ship.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors huff and puff as they push the large sacks of basalt stones across the belly of the ship, progressively tipping the vessel's balance until its pierced flank leans away from the water. The ship is carefully led to the shore, where the crew can finally start repairs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802657</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A ludicrous plan.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors wheeze and gasp as they try to pull the basalt sacks, but their efforts are not enough to budge the ballast into place. The ship remains steady, allowing more and more water in and sinking with the intrusion. Several sailors drown, trapped between the deck's roof and the swirling currents, and their bodies cannot be evacuated before the storm calms down.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802649</GUID><Text>Drug them to avoid losing any more time</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802658</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Safe and drunk.&lt;/b&gt; The merchants accept the liquid courage and drink its laced contents, falling asleep before they can finish their bottle. They're dragged to the lower deck with the rest of the crew and what supplies the sailors could carry, their combined weight counterbalancing the pounding of the waves. The storm soon calms down and leaves the crew to deal with the hangover of their passengers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802659</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Too weak.&lt;/b&gt; The drinks your sailors offer to the merchants in an attempt to soothe their anger are far too poorly made to have any kind of impact on them. As they continue to struggle against your crew, a vivid growl resonates in the ship: it came too close to shore, and the reefs pierced your hull! Water starts to pour in the lower decks.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802645</GUID><Text>Improvise a sea anchor on the surface of the water</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802660</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sea anchor works properly.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors bind planks with a docking line and lest the makeshift anchor with a ripped sail, before letting the construction drop into the waves. It sips the water in its cloth, bobbing with the sea, pulling against the water to increase its drag. Your ship gains enough stability to keep its broadside away from the waves and the crew, relieved, can wait for the storm to pass.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802661</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sea anchor sinks as soon as it touches the water.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors tack together extra sails to try and assemble a sea anchor, but the ballooning cloths snap as soon as they're thrown into the waves. As the ship is pushed towards the shore the backwash gets more and more ample, until a rogue wave of ludicrous proportions rises above the sea. Your merchant passengers beg your crew to save them!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802662</GUID><Text>Face the wave head on</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802665</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Fearless.&lt;/b&gt; Despite the battering gale and clobbering currents, your crew manages to keep the ship straight and face the rogue wave head on. The wave crashes into your vessel with all its rage and natural power, but the straight prow cuts its fury in two and the ship avoids most of the damage - a rock among the waters. When the storm calms down, your crew focuses on the repairs and considers how exceptional their survival was.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802666</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Too audacious.&lt;/b&gt; The gusts of wind fill your sails and the frantic currents pull your hull, and your crew is way too untrained to keep their reins over the ship. Entailed by the sea's passion, the ship leaps and falls, dancing until the shore catches it and stops its mad waltz. The vessel's carcass stays still, water and bodies flowing from its bent silhouette.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802664</GUID><Text>Throw the oil cargo overboard to calm the seas</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802669</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The water's anger dies out!&lt;/b&gt; Moving the merchants aside with ease and dismissing their plea, your sailors heave the oil barrels over the railings and let their contents spill around the ship. The oil hugs the water and rolls over the waves, dissolving the wind's grip and slowing the water's movement. The threat of the waves is no more, but the merchants' trust and cargo were lost in the process.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802670</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Their greed overcomes your strength.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors try to reason, then to force the merchants into giving up their precious oil, but your crew is weak in both body and spirit while the merchants have built their fortunes on hard-headedness. Long after the ship has been hit, crushed, and stranded, the merchants's cadavers are found lying on the shore's pebbles, still clutching their barrels of cargo.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800312</GUID><Text>Opera House in the Jungle</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800313</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'It's too narrow and shallow this far upriver!'&lt;/b&gt; warns the steersman. Escorting Mr. Cardinale to the site of his rainforest opera house now seems all the more preposterous! The great patron of the arts twizzles his moustache in frustration! Apart from braving the difficulty ahead, only traversing a nearby hill might reconnect the expedition with the upper river.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800314</GUID><Text>Use your gunboat to navigate the shallows</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800318</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The design of the gunboat is vital to your success.&lt;/b&gt; Being of moderate size, and yet possessing the manoeuvring capabilities of a much smaller ship, the gunboat is able to navigate the awkward river shallows with ease. Mr. Cardinale is delighted that you have delivered him to the site of his proposed Opera House, and promises to talk favourably of each and every man when he returns to civilisation.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800315</GUID><Text>Have the ship transported over the hill to rejoin the river further up</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800319</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'What a champion performance!' squeals Mr. Cardinale,&lt;/b&gt; from the comfort of his cushioned chair. The great ship seems to swim up and over the hill. The long timbers on which it rolls, and corkscrew winches at intervals up the slope work perfectly. 'I shall put in a good word for you all at the club,' promises Cardinale, as the ship splashes down safely on the other side. The men are immensely proud of the miracle they have performed.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800320</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Getting a ship over a hill is mad, but it works.&lt;/b&gt; 'Is this absolutely necessary?' muses Mr. Cardinale having watched the crew slip for a week in mud. But the rolling timbers and makeshift winches they have crafted prove adequate, and the ship finally scrapes down the other side, into the upper river. Mr. Cardinale barely offers a word of thanks, perturbed perhaps, by the indignity of it all.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800321</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There simply aren't enough materials&lt;/b&gt; to conduct such an elaborate enterprise. The crew think with a few extra bits and bobs, dragging the ship up the hill might be possible.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800323</GUID><Text>Proceed uphill without materials, belief will guide us through</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800325</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The men have the conviction&lt;/b&gt; to safely hoist the ship up and over the hill. It is a fatiguing week, but belief in making the impossible possible possesses them. When the ship finally splashes into the water, Mr. Cardinale has barely a Christian word of thanks for the crew. It has taken a long enough after all.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800326</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is all going so well,&lt;/b&gt; this mad idea, with winches and cables scarcely sufficient for the task. But exertion eventually tells. As the ship rocks over the crest of the hill, there is not enough to keep it there, and it hurtles wildly down the other side. It is lucky the ship is not swept away in the river current. Still, it sustains significant damage from impact with the trees.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800327</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'I think it's going to give way!'&lt;/b&gt; cries the terrified Mr. Cardinale. The feet of your men slip and slide on the slope, as the unholy weight of the ship overcomes the winches, and it plummets back down the hill. Men try to get out of the way, but are crushed beneath the keel. The hideous accident signals the end of Cardinale's operatic ambitions.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800324</GUID><Text>Ask the locals gathered around the scene if they are able to help</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800328</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The locals are willing to provide help and materials.&lt;/b&gt; While it takes the crew time to incorporate the materials into their winch design, the locals are happy to wait. Good relations make the feat of hoisting a ship over a hill less painful than it might have been. The boat finally clatters down into the water of the upper river. All are most grateful to the locals, without whom none of this would have been possible.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800329</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A few locals vaguely offer to help,&lt;/b&gt; but their lukewarm efforts do little to relieve the exhausted crew. The ridiculous hill-climb takes more than a week. When the ship finally slips into the water over the other side, not even Mr. Cardinale has energy enough to care.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800330</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The locals have absolutely no interest in helping you,&lt;/b&gt; and fade into the trees. Beleaguered by shouts from Mr. Cardinale, the men meekly follow orders. The mad persistence has disastrous consequences. The ship plummets back down the hill! Many try to get out of the way, but are crushed beneath the keel. The hideous accident signals the end of Cardinale's operatic ambitions.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800322</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'I think it's going to give way!' cries the terrified Mr. Cardinale.&lt;/b&gt; The feet of your men slip and slide on the mudstrewn slope, as the great weight of the ship plummets it back down the hill. Many try to get out of the way, but are crushed beneath the keel. A hideous accident caused by inadequate materials, that signals the end of Cardinale's operatic ambitions.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800316</GUID><Text>Attempt to carefully navigate the narrow passage</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800331</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Competent navigation&lt;/b&gt; rescues your ship from the mother of all rivers. Mr. Cardinale is tremulous throughout, believing his dreams may beach like a river dolphin at any time. But over the course of three tricky days, information is relayed quickly enough between wheel and forecastle to avoid any harmful collisions. There is relief all around when the corner is made and the river broadens again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800332</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'Rapids?!' exhales Mr. Cardinale crossly.&lt;/b&gt; Ahead white water churns. There is nothing for it but to push on. As the ship strains against the current, there are dreadful noises from rocks on the keel. The crew wince at each and every thump and screech. Finally, after a week, the river broadens again, and the crew can inspect the damage - it doesn't look good.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800333</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is a heart-breaking experience.&lt;/b&gt; Days go by in the effort to lever the ship out of the sandy shallows, where it does not belong. It is battered by rocks and rapids, and leaks like a rusted bucket. Mr. Cardinale kicks up and awful fuss. Finally when it feels like progress is being made, the next bend reveals a harrowing sight - an insurmountable waterfall! Never have the crew felt more hopeless.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800317</GUID><Text>Decline to proceed any further and return to sea</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800334</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Mr. Cardinale is incensed&lt;/b&gt; that his grand plans for the rainforest Opera House have been thwarted.

'Temporary strapping,' he says, 'but should get us home.' The officer and rest of the party make shelter with little time left to spare.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800953</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor knows nothing of urgency.&lt;/b&gt; 'Give my patient space!' he snaps at those trying to move things along. Meanwhile, a blizzard sweeps the ravine, and the onset of frostbite is enough to split the party. Neither the doctor nor his unfortunate patient are to be seen again.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800951</GUID><Text>Hope they manage alone</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800954</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You knew deep down not all would make it.&lt;/b&gt; 'They're all returned but the injured fellow,' comes the news.

Over a verge, appears a shrine with a great bell - the source of the sound - and beyond, a pilgrims' path to the foot of the mountain.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800958</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A non-believer falls to his death.&lt;/b&gt; 'Those lacking conviction shall be tried and judged in this place,' echoes the priest. The rest edge to safety, consoled by the apparent goodness in their hearts.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800960</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Nothing but a demonic howl.&lt;/b&gt; The blizzard rises anew. Without hope to keep them aloft, it is no surprise when a ledge gives way, damning to hell below.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800956</GUID><Text>Urge your party to face their fears</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800961</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A song of solidarity rises through the line of snow-crusted faces.&lt;/b&gt; Clinging to what they most cherish, they edge to safety. Had they not been reminded of such incentives, it is doubtful they would have survived.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800962</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Only some take strength.&lt;/b&gt; The rest remain in a frozen huddle. They may have lacked courage to negotiate the high ledge, but will welcome in their icy death with creditable stoicism.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800945</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A far more treacherous path&lt;/b&gt;, but your crew are committed now. A steep cliff ahead must be negotiated, and your ropes are too short.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800965</GUID><Text>Craft longer ropes and swing down</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800966</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;All are saved, at a cost.&lt;/b&gt; Putting the ropes together is quite a task with frozen fingers. That the party are able to cling to the rope as they descend is a small miracle. Nevertheless, frostbite will do lasting damage to their digits.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800967</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A small but critical detail is overlooked.&lt;/b&gt; Grip. A man falls from the top of the rope with a cry, tumbling those below him into the abyss like meat from a skewer. Only a few frozen grimaces survive.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800964</GUID><Text>Free climb</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800968</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is a risky business.&lt;/b&gt; Though the cliff isn't lacking in handholds, this is a test of individual endurance.

As they fall, the will to survive in the others strengthens.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800937</GUID><Text>Await help</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800946</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Shelter is minimal.&lt;/b&gt; Huddling cannot keep out the cold.

But hope springs eternal! A muddy river strikes through the arid basin. The crew are delirious when they realise it is not completely dried-up. Do you stop for water, or press on?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801065</GUID><Text>Trust the Botanist's expertise.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801069</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The botanist foams at the mouth with thirst-quenching theories.&lt;/b&gt; 'The best idea may be these trees. Cut them just here, and catch the drip of water beneath,' they say, as they take a knife to the bark. Before an hour has passed, there's enough water to soothe a beached humpback.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801066</GUID><Text>Fashion a device to extract water from mud.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801070</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;'The secret is boiling the water'&lt;/b&gt;, says one resourceful survivalist, 'and needless to say a mixture of charcoal, sand and cloth makes a fine filter.' With water drawn, filtered and boiled, the crew can be sure it is safe to drink. Time even for a mud bath - your safari brigade slopping about like happy hippo.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801071</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The water still has a mighty pong&lt;/b&gt;, despite all solids having been separated out by the rudimentary device. Several feel terribly ill after drinking. A treatment can be improvised, or the survey can try to hold out until the rendezvous.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801077</GUID><Text>Improvise a treatment</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801079</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sickness clears over time.&lt;/b&gt; 'With dysentery the patient must rest,' the sensible doctor said, 'away from the others.' With the last of the good water, and gentle nursing, the caravan reaches the rendezvous in fair health.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801080</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;No-one is ready for dysentery.&lt;/b&gt; The sick are empty and weak, no fluids to replenish all they have lost. With only vague measures in place to prevent the spread, savannah delirium reigns. The survey never reaches the rendezvous.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801078</GUID><Text>Hurry to the rendezvous</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801081</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Haste saves some, but not all.&lt;/b&gt; Dysentery is thoroughly set in by the time the survey makes the rendezvous. Although the camp provides the sick every comfort, for many the rigours of the sickness prove too much.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801072</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Hours under hot sun, for fatally little.&lt;/b&gt; Countless designs in the soil, and no prototype. When something is finally cobbled together, the fools test their stupid sieve with the last of the clean supply. It will be a miracle now if anyone survives.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801067</GUID><Text>Look for the source of the river</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801073</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Finding a river source is easy&lt;/b&gt;, but turning it into a shortcut...? That takes brains. High above the dry basin, water piles blissfully into the gully. The men wouldn't miss a swim beneath a waterfall for the world!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801074</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's water, if you can get to it.&lt;/b&gt; Hippos are gathered all along the bank. This is their territory. If you don't refill here, there's no guarantee you'll find water further on.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801082</GUID><Text>Scare the hippos away</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801087</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Hip hip hooray!&lt;/b&gt; The hippos run as fast as their stout legs will carry them. The serenity of the river bank is utterly destroyed, but none of your crew care, as they help themselves to bucketfuls of clean and highly quaffable drinking water.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801083</GUID><Text>Approach the water cautiously</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801088</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Someone knows their hippopotami.&lt;/b&gt; A kinship with the animals allows the gentle river bank to be shared. Fresh water is relayed by the bucket. A few nervous moments as a large female rears out of the water, but she just wants a bird to pick her teeth. Satisfied, the crew resume their trek to the rendezvous.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801089</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's movement in the hippo camp&lt;/b&gt;, as the crew approach, followed by violent evacuations of their gigantic nostrils. Mandolin jaws open wide in display, and it is pretty clear to the crew they have no choice but to back off.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801090</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A game of unhappy hippos ensues!&lt;/b&gt; The water swirls with their pudgy bodies. They snort and scream, and prepare to charge.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801091</GUID><Text>Fire at the charging hippo</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801093</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Cold, but effective.&lt;/b&gt; The brigade focus fire at the closest hippo, and soon it is dead. The other hippos falter, bellowed howls of grief echoing around the basin. As the blood of the majestic animal suffuses with the river, your crew must now find the audacity to drink.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801094</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The hippos bowl into your nine-pin soldiers.&lt;/b&gt; One is dead on impact. Others die slow, trampled or drowning, matchstick guns floating downriver like poohsticks.

Out here, it is such ruthlessness that separates the living from the dead.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801097</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What shot hits, barely passes through blubber.&lt;/b&gt; The whole bloat of hippos charge, leaving them an instant to make a decision.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801098</GUID><Text>Fire at the hippos</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801100</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Cold, but effective.&lt;/b&gt; The brigade focus fire at the closest hippo, and soon it is dead.

The crew have lost half a day's march on the rendezvous, for a bit of muddy water.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801104</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A waste of time.&lt;/b&gt; The hippos leave at dusk to graze. Unfortunately, their patch is just a stone's throw away. Their aqueous eyes can be seen glistening in the moonlight, and no-one wants to risk it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801075</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Following a river should have been easy.&lt;/b&gt; But your party are so focused on distant goals, they fail to look immediately ahead. Suddenly, a man shoots downward as if yanked by giant hands. There are holes everywhere - an underground system of caves, and a tomb for your unlucky crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801068</GUID><Text>Press on to the rendezvous</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801076</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There was never enough water for all of them.&lt;/b&gt; A freak mist has the crew licking air with cracked tongues, but nothing can keep the wolf from the door. Several drop dead as old bone, before the safari staggers to the rendezvous camp.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801587</GUID><Text>Sunken Depths</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801588</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Unusual debris float among the waves.&lt;/b&gt; Mold-ridden planks of wood, strings of cloth, fragments of broken plaster, all tinted by the gray shade of time. Filled with childish excitation, the crew discusses the possibility of going underwater to uncover the debris' origin.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801589</GUID><Text>Send your diver into the depths</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801592</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The diver plunges into the ocean with fish-like ease.&lt;/b&gt; He follows the trail of debris through the murky waters and almost smacks into a wall of indescribable height. Unsure whether the obstacle is natural or man-made, the diver wanders along its smooth facade until he finds an uncanny artefact and resurfaces with it. His account of the underwater mystery fascinates the crew.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801590</GUID><Text>Improvise a diving bell</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801593</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The diving bell looks decent and feels solid.&lt;/b&gt; Two men climb aboard and the bell plunges into the depths while a whole group of sailors pumps air into its ventilation tube. The bell descends until it is stopped by a surface of coral. Underneath the colorful shapes, the sailors notice a silver coin on their left and a gaping, perfectly circular hole on their right.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801595</GUID><Text>Hope that it will resist the dive and push the bell into the hole</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801597</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Their trust in the work of their comrades pays.&lt;/b&gt; The bell slithers in a slow fall which allows the bewitched divers to take in the view. This is no sunken ship: the engraved hole was a window among a hundred more lining a hall of ridiculous proportions. A single ray of light, pouring from the hole, accompanies the bell's descent until it lands on what might have been statue alcoves. A shining green pearl lies in the lowest part of the alcove.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801599</GUID><Text>Ignore the pearl and risk the dive into darkness</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801601</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Call it luck or miracle, but the bell holds.&lt;/b&gt; One of the men lights the bell's lamp and the other dives, following the glow as it illuminates the silent scene below: ghostly statues of hunting scenes, collapsed frescoes depicting plentiful gardens, and a massive throne of fractured marble on which a sword waits, covered in fluttering kelp. When the artifact is brought back to the surface and cleaned up, it reveals a weapon of exquisite quality, embedded with unknown jewels and metals.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801602</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Lady Luck does not smile for the faithless.&lt;/b&gt; As the bell descends into the dark, so does the pressure rise and press against the makeshift protection. The sailors pull the signal rope in a panic, but despite their fervent prayers, they are not pulled up in time. All that the crew manages to retrieve from the sea are the broken bell and its broken contents.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801600</GUID><Text>Retrieve the pearl from the dead-end and resurface</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801603</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The pearl is made of pure jade!&lt;/b&gt; The crew marvels at it and all want to touch it, feel it, smell it. The pearl spreads a nostalgic fragrance of salt water, fresh moss and damp stones, and the sailors agree this might be the very smell of adventure.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801598</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The bell doesn't resist the fall.&lt;/b&gt; Instead of gliding along the sides of the hole, the bell tilts, letting the water in. The men call for help and the crew immediately tries to pull them up, fighting against what rocks snare the bell, doing their best to save their mates, and unable to react when the rope snaps into their hands. They are left to mourn their sea-buried companions.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801596</GUID><Text>Pick up the coin and resurface</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801604</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Low risk, low reward.&lt;/b&gt; The diving bell emerges without a scratch and the crew enjoys the tiny silver coin, passing it around and commenting on its singular aspect. Their excitement can only survive for so long and the coin is stored in the officers' coffers while the sailors whisper what ifs leading to grander treasures.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801594</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The homemade diving bell falls apart.&lt;/b&gt; The engineers, specialized in complex ship machinery, have no idea on how to make such a simple device. Their machine departs with two men onboard, and they continue to dive while the bell itself stays afloat. When the divers emerge, the engineers take an earful and the crew is too disheartened to make a new attempt.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801591</GUID><Text>Ignore the beckoning junk</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801605</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The sailors protest but understand the risk.&lt;/b&gt; As the ship goes on its way, its wake drowns the singular ruins and their promise of adventure.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802000</GUID><Text>Cracks in the Hull</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802002</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Water in the hull!&lt;/b&gt; The overloaded ship could only go so far with this many supplies in its belly: a series of strong waves sends the crates churning and the boat's stomach soon explodes. Cracks pierce the hull where the cargo hit it, and trickles of water pop one after the other in the storage space.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802003</GUID><Text>Use the electric water pump to allow proper repairs</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802006</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Specific solutions for specific situations: your preparation was on point.&lt;/b&gt; The electric pump roars and swallows water much faster that it can infiltrate the ship, allowing the sailors to repair the damage with ease.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802004</GUID><Text>Improvise a water pump to allow immediate repairs</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802007</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew's craftiness has a solution for everything.&lt;/b&gt; Using communication tubes as the pump's body and spare metal sheets as paddles, the sailors manage to assemble what could pass for a proper water pump. A good dozen of men is needed to make it work, but they buy enough time for proper repairs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802008</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;This joke of a pump looks like it came from the Dark Ages.&lt;/b&gt; As the sailors battle to have their own idea of a pump prevail over the others, they assemble a monster that does nothing more than blow bubbles. One of the cracks bursts in a spray of water that silences the machine and starts flooding the hull.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802016</GUID><Text>Throw supplies overboard to try and bring the crack over the waterline</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802010</GUID><Text>Seal the overflowing section, regardless of what or who might still be inside</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802011</GUID><Text>Make a decision, who knows what happens if you don't!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802017</GUID><Text>Okay</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802012</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The ship rises over the water, but at what cost?&lt;/b&gt; Sailors watch their supplies drift away from the vessel, their hearts lingering after the lost items until the officers remind them of the emergency of repairs.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802018</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802013</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There's nothing to be done.&lt;/b&gt; The ship slowly sinks, pulled into the water with each new fracture in its hull. Cargo and crew are washed by the leakage and the ship vomits their remains when it crashes on the shore. The survivors contemplate the wreckage in despair before trying to put the ship back in shape.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802014</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Cargo and crew are set to drown in the leakage.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors close the hull's doors on their comrades, hushing their screams. However, there is no avoiding reopening the hull when time comes for repairs: the water flows out, carrying bodies transfixed in expressions of suffocation, terror, and betrayal.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802005</GUID><Text>Seal the damaged section and repair it at the next harbour</Text></Text><Text><GUID>802015</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The drown cargo cannot be salvaged.&lt;/b&gt; When the ship finally finds a harbour, its hull is so low under the waterline your crew fears the boat will sink. Although such fears are unfounded, the leakage drowned a good part of their stored food, and the repairs feel like they should have be done much earlier.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800503</GUID><Text>The Singular Case of the Midshipman</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800504</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Midshipman is found with his throat slit, knife in hand.&lt;/b&gt; It would appear to be suicide, but appearances often prove deceptive. Understandably, the whole crew crowd the scene, debating whether he was the type to take his own life, or if someone might have gained by his passing. Needless to say, they expect some action be taken...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800506</GUID><Text>The Expert will have the answers</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800509</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There are gasps of macabre delight,&lt;/b&gt; as the famous detective reveals the only possible solution. 'Elementary you see. Look at this tiny moth wing on the body. Moths are drawn to light, and the sole light this night past issued from... this man's LANTERN!!' The detective lunges across the deck and secures the watchman, who being as impressed with the deduction as everyone else, readily admits to having sought to gain rank by the murder.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800507</GUID><Text>Commence an investigation</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800510</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Careful analysis of the scene&lt;/b&gt; reveals two leads. Some believe an autopsy would leave the facts of the case plain, while others reckon the little time available should be spent analysing any evidence at the scene that might establish whodunnit.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800512</GUID><Text>Conduct an autopsy of the body</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800514</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The autopsy is conducted very capably,&lt;/b&gt; and confirms the midshipman took his own life. A severe tumour is also discovered on the midshipman's brain. A letter, found later, serves to explain that the fellow knew he hadn't long to live, and wished to face death in his own way. The crew are galvanised on hearing this story of bravery.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800515</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The autopsy is sufficient to confirm it was murder.&lt;/b&gt; Strangulation was the cause of death, not a slit throat - which was added post-mortem. All else remains unknown. Nevertheless, with the cause of death established, the list of suspects is narrowed down to just a few who had the means and the motive for the crime.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800517</GUID><Text>Interrogate until someone confesses</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800519</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You out the grim truth.&lt;/b&gt; The alibi of one sailor does not match his fellows, and he cracks, confessing to the midshipman's murder. It transpires the midshipman had bragged of bedding the other man's wife. The murderer expresses only remorse for his crime, and as the noose is placed around his neck, the crew regret that justice must be so severe.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800520</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The interrogation is painfully haphazard.&lt;/b&gt; Though it is clear one of the suspects must be the killer, lines of inquiry fail to produce answers. No option remains but to offload all the suspects at the next port to prevent further incident. It is a source of great shame to the crew that fine innocent sailors are certain to be among them.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800518</GUID><Text>Beat out a confession</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800521</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;A brutal approach, but one delivering quick results.&lt;/b&gt; It seems the midshipman was preparing to whistle-blow unauthorised smuggling below deck, and was killed for it. The ringleaders threatened others with a similar fate if they didn't keep quiet. The culprits are unceremoniously shot, and the vulgar matter is over.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800522</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Torture seldom results in happiness.&lt;/b&gt; Your victim screams a confession, perhaps in the hope it will end the pain. With nothing else to go on, you scapegoat the poor beggar, and he is keelhauled until dead. The crew are in no doubt that this was the wrong man, and hope to escape your inhuman expedition at the first opportunity.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800516</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The autopsy is dreadfully clumsy,&lt;/b&gt; and leaves the body almost unrecognisable. The unschooled 'medic' evidently have a point to prove, and insist on defiling it further, despite being a bundle of nerves. By the end the morgue looks like a butchery, and the stricken mortician runs wildly about the ship, scalpel in hand. Several are injured trying to restrain him, but the psychological trauma of an unsolved mystery is twice as damaging.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800513</GUID><Text>Fashion a tool for gathering forensic evidence</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800523</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;What innovation!&lt;/b&gt; A bright young spark applies some of the latest forensic researches. The knife used to cut the midshipman's neck is placed inside an airtight box along with vapours belonging to the doctor. As if by magic, when removed, clear sets of fingerprints appear on the shaft! When the crew prints are taken, the guilty party is collared in the most satisfying modern fashion!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800524</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It's complicated&lt;/b&gt; identifying footwear and gait. Ambitious of the crew then, to attempt to solve both problems with the one device. Still the notched stick-wheel does prove footprints at the scene are suspicious, and that suspects are limited to just a few matches. But how to get to the bottom of this?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800526</GUID><Text>Let there be a trial</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800529</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The trial goes as well as can be expected.&lt;/b&gt; The suspects are cross-examined, and proceedings recorded with quill and ink. The shoe-prints belong to a solemn old gent, whose testimony reveals him to be the midshipman's secret lover - the reason he was unforthcoming. He confirms the dead man intended suicide from guilt at their relationship, and was  trying to prevent it, but arrived too late. All are grateful that the truth is finally out.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>800530</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The trial is a farce.&lt;/b&gt; Sailors bark questions from the sidelines which the suspects are quite within their rights to leave unanswered.

The entire assault must have been a diversion to sneak them in and out with the papers! You and Hannah may never know the truth unless you get them back. They have quite a headstart, but you might catch them in a chase. Alternatively, as few harbours nearby will grant them sanctuary, you can try to anticipate their likely heading.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801666</GUID><Text>Let them run, and instead try to establish their likely destination</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801668</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"There! We have them," your navigator smiles.&lt;/b&gt; "See? Here." The finger traces a route behind Ventura island. "Remarkable how few options they have. Montoya is the only port they might blend in for fifty leagues." Sure enough, you intercept one of the tiny vessels off Montoya's twinkling bay. It may be no match for your own ship, but to sink them outright risks losing that precious contract to the water.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801670</GUID><Text>Try to disable them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801671</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Crackerjack! The perfect shot.&lt;/b&gt; Though a slender target, the mast snaps through, burying its operators in debris, and leaving the boat dead in the water. With the freedom of their ship, your crew find an ingenious-looking machine, but no sign of the Prosperity contract. Nevertheless, you are certain it must therefore have changed hands in nearby Montoya, and make a beeline for the port.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801672</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Only a partial success&lt;b&gt;, as the fire forces the Pyrphorians to turn to face you. Sensing they might still have a chance in a fight, the Pyrphorians prime what few small dragon cannons they have.

The Pyrphorians make their escape, but you know they are headed. If your crew manage to recover both themselves and their dignity, you will make a beeline for the port of Montoya.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801678</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It works this time.&lt;/b&gt; With a shorter range to target, your competent cannoneers have no trouble picking out the mast. It buries the enemy in debris, and leaves the sail-less boat adrift. With the freedom of their ship, your crew find some arcane Pyrphorian devices, but no sign of the Prosperity contract. Knowing it can only have changed hands in nearby Montoya, you make a beeline for the port.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801679</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Pyrphorian ship is agile.&lt;/b&gt; "Never seen an enemy move like that," explains one of your cannoneers, as if to avoid some weeping confession of his inexperience. Sensing they may be a match after all, the Pyrphorians use what firepower they have, giving your ship a fair lick of flame. The ensuing panic gives them time to slip away. You will no doubt pick up their trail again in the port of Montoya, but the fire has caused damage that must be repaired first.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801673</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Miles off!&lt;/b&gt; Your novice gunners are so desperate to avoid striking the enemy in any meaningful way, that a small inoffensive patch of sea takes the brunt instead. Sensing their tiny ship is a match for yours after all, the Pyrphorians pump flame from dragon cannons, and give your ship a good licking. The ensuing panic gives them time to slip away. You will no doubt pick up their trail again in the port of Montoya, but the fire has caused significant damage that must be repaired first.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801680</GUID><Text>Try to board them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801681</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew lick their lips.&lt;/b&gt; You thought they seemed the types to enjoy tussles at close quarters, and so it proves.

Picking through their ship reveals some arcane Pyrphorian devices, but no sign of the Prosperity contract. Knowing it can only have changed hands in nearby Montoya, you make a beeline for the port.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801686</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The shot seems to pass through them,&lt;/b&gt; as if beneath mask and cloak their bodies are incorporeal, or perhaps your marksmen are drunk. Either way, it allows the Pyrphorians to turn and catch a strong westerly squall. They are halfway to the bay of Montoya before your sailors can reposition. You will have to rely on picking up their trail when you get there.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801687</GUID><Text>Train your main guns on their cannons</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801688</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Destructive, but effective.&lt;/b&gt; Shot explodes onto the Pyrphorian deck, and the weighty flame cannons drop through the boards. With the freedom of the ship, your crew find some arcane Pyrphorian devices, but no sign of the Prosperity contract. Knowing it can only have changed hands in nearby Montoya, you make a beeline for the port.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801689</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your fool cannoneers sank them!&lt;/b&gt; Exactly what they weren't supposed to do. Several miserable hours are spent combing the soggy wreckage, with no sign of the contract. "You won't find it," a bloody-mouthed Pyrphorian grins, but his dying taunt is a clue. He implies the contract changed hands before you intercepted the ship. Being the only haven for miles around, you set a course for the port of Montoya.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801690</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your soldiers lack initiative&lt;/b&gt;, and it is the Pyrphorians who swing aboard your ship, brandishing torches and firing elegant pocket pistols. Though their zeal cannot be matched, they are outnumbered. By the time they are subdued, they have pinned two, and burned many others. The accomplices in their boat are already halfway to Montoya. Once your groaning survivors have been gauzed-up, you might still find them there. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801691</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Hmmn..." your navigator mumbles awkwardly&lt;/b&gt;, realising he has proposed almost every one of the myriad small harbours in the region. Someone coughs. Perhaps all these officers have been summoned to the cabin merely to share in his humiliation? "We have lost them then..." a skeptic pipes up, addressing the elephant in the room. "So what now?! Search every harbour?! Solicit a friendly local power for help?!!"  </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801692</GUID><Text>Check every nearby harbour in the hope of finding them</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801693</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The clouds finally part over Montoya.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew had been about to give up, until by chance, one of the two small ships from the battle was sighted. Moored in a secluded corner of the bay, it is the empty, but unmistakably property of that shadowy Pyrphorian entity. The contract must surely still be somewhere here in Montoya.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801694</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Needles and haystacks.&lt;/b&gt; You exhaust all feasible harbours. Not only is there no sign of your quarry, there is no method of knowing whether they have been and gone from a place, or if they were never there at all. The sea seems godless, wide and deep, and the crew long for it to swallow them up. Instead, however, they must return to Miss Hannah Goode, to explain their failure.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801695</GUID><Text>Entreat the local authorities for information</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801696</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You are made to wait in line.&lt;/b&gt; Your diplomats may have done well to remember the crest as a on loyal to the Queen, but you are not the only envoys present. Daiquiris, bananas and soft furnishings are small compensation for the time lost. Despite these formalities, the prefect transpires to be loyal. He intimates that Montoya is the only nearby place he has knowledge of, that the Pyrphorians have their claws into. You cross fingers, and head there.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801697</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"They must have been in league with the Pyrphorians!"&lt;/b&gt; wails your duped diplomat. Having failed to detect local complicity— rooted either in fear or allegiance— your diplomat insists you sail south along the coast. Your expedition continues diligently for three days in that direction without sighting a single human settlement. "Since you're so fine with words," says the lieutenant to the diplomat in question, "perhaps you should explain our failure to Miss. Hannah Goode!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801698</GUID><Text>Trust your lookouts to keep you in range</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801699</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The lookout never loses them&lt;/b&gt;, despite the vessel being nearly out of sight. As its small grey outline rounds an island, the lookout gestures excitedly to starboard. He has seen the golden thread of an inlet, by the navigation of which you may cut the nose off the cape, and intercept the Pyrphorians on the other side.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801700</GUID><Text>Take a shortcut via the inlet</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801701</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You emerge right on top of them!&lt;/b&gt; Swinging masterfully through the stone jaws that gate the inlet, your navigators traverse a fantasy lagoon. Bursting beyond it to the bay, their ambush is received with complete surprise. With the freedom of the Pyrphorian ship, your crew find an ingenious-looking machine, but no sign of the Prosperity contract. Nevertheless, you are certain it must therefore have changed hands in nearby Montoya, and make a beeline for the port.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801702</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It is clear now why the Pyrphorians did not use the inlet themselves.&lt;/b&gt; Perhaps they were more willing to admit they had not the skill to navigate it without risking their ship. The inlet chokes, and a tooth-like incisor of rock rakes the boards from your hull. Limping out on the other side, you have made up the distance enough to see the Pyrphorians are headed to the port of Montoya. Your crew are very glad, since your ship is now in dire need of repair. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801703</GUID><Text>Maintain course, following them around the island</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801704</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Pyrphorians realise they must make port or be caught.&lt;/b&gt; As you round the cape, you see they are headed for the nearby settlement of Montoya. "Though we may not have caught them by sea," says your navigator, "they may have given away much more in leading us here; the only such haven for miles around." </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801705</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The lookout loses them.&lt;/b&gt; Complacency sets in, when at first you appear to be catching them, but upon rounding a cape, you find they have vanished! Bright white settlements cluster the sound like a fairy circle, it seems they could have docked in any of them. "We have lost them!" a skeptic pipes up, "so what now?! Stick a pin in the map?! Solicit a friendly local power for help?!!"</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801706</GUID><Text>Study the map to guess their most likely docking point</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801707</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The navigator is as sure of himself&lt;/b&gt; as he can be in the circumstances. "If I were Pyrphorian, god help me, I would head for Montoya," his finger circles the large settlement, "it has a large marina where my devilish vessel might be easily concealed." Upon searching Montoya harbour, they indeed find the Pyrphorian ship in a secluded corner of mangrove. That being well, they must hope now they have not lost too much time.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801708</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The navigator is as much as a failure as the lookout.&lt;/b&gt; Your ship makes a cat's cradle of the sound, as the navigator drags you hopelessly from one port to the next, almost at random. "Since you're so fine with directions," says the lieutenant to the diplomat in question, "perhaps you should explain where it was we went off course to Miss. Hannah Goode!" </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801709</GUID><Text>Entreat nearby local authorities for information</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801710</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;You are made to wait in line.&lt;/b&gt; Your diplomats may have done well to remember the crest as a on loyal to the Queen, but you are not the only envoys present. Daiquiris, bananas and soft furnishings are small compensation for the time lost. Despite these formalities, the prefect transpires to be loyal. He intimates that Montoya is the only nearby place he has knowledge of, that the Pyrphorians have their claws into.

Yet, tranquil it is not. Anxiety is written in every passing face. They must know who you are and what you seek, but finding one brave enough to share is a different matter. You can ask around, or rely instead on your own eyes to find clues.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801715</GUID><Text>Ask the local Montoyans if they know anything</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801716</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your attaché hits it off with the harbourmaster&lt;/b&gt;, presenting you (not entirely falsely) as a fellow port official sympathetic to the Pyrphorian problem in the region. "I am sick of it," says the Montoyan, "whenever they come here it is a nightmare for us! If you take will action, it will be my pleasure to assist." Out on the sun-baked rooftop he points upriver. "There, at the casona." A large verdant ranch wavers in the distance, the sanctuary of the Pyrphorians.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801717</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The only one who may be willing to help you is a Great Plainsman.&lt;/b&gt; The softly-spoken giant is hauling thick rope at the dock. "I would be putting my life at risk," he says gravely, looking over his shoulder. He seems to know something.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801750</GUID><Text>A little recompense always calms the nerves</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801718</GUID><Text>The Great Plainsman looks nervously over your goods.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801998</GUID><Text>Bribe</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801721</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"That should be enough to get me out of here,"&lt;/b&gt; he says, inspecting the merchandise. "They have taken the big ranch for their gatherings. You'll need a lot more than this if you hoping to break in— see all these people? There's a reason they're afraid." You head for the ranch on the outskirts of Montoya, to where darkness awaits.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801751</GUID><Text>Cancel</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801722</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"No!" he says&lt;/b&gt;, unwilling to risk his life for such scant reward. He glances around, sweeping back his long dark hair. It seems increasingly unlikely he will co-operate.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801719</GUID><Text>Threaten it out of him</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801723</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;He raises his hands, impressed, while remaining wary.&lt;/b&gt; "Perhaps you can be the ones to finally unseat them," he says, pointing upriver, "they have taken the big ranch for their gatherings. When you go there, expect trouble." He looks your soldiers up and down again, "even if you do seem prepared."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801724</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Seen enough of that in my lifetime,"&lt;/b&gt; he says with quiet defiance. Your soldiers hang their heads— with the Pyrphorians here, Montoyans hardly need you stirring up more trouble. "If all you have to offer is violence, take it to those who deserve it," he says, gesturing at a decrepit-looking warehouse towards the end of the quay. Then he disappears without so much as a farewell. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801720</GUID><Text>Reassure him</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801725</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;"Your envoy is right," he says&lt;/b&gt;, "I can cover my tracks well enough." He nods upriver. "They have taken the big ranch for their gatherings. You better be ready if you hope to break in— see all these people? There's a reason they're afraid." You head for the ranch on the outskirts of Montoya, to where darkness awaits.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801726</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;He sighs deeply and rolls his eyes.&lt;/b&gt; "If you can't convince me, good luck convincing them to stop what they have begun," he says, gesturing at a decrepit-looking warehouse at the end of the quay. Then he disappears without so much as a farewell. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801727</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your attaché's weepy plea&lt;/b&gt; is better received than anyone who had to hear it could have expected. "Of course we will help you stand against this terrible evil!" A local man says cheerfully, leading you to the end of the pier, where &lt;b&gt;a rather decrepit warehouse stands&lt;/b&gt;. "This is it, we're all counting on you," he whispers encouragingly at the door, before hurrying away.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801728</GUID><Text>Smash down the warehouse door and charge in</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801729</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Of course, the Pyrphorians have been waiting.&lt;/b&gt; The warehouse appears to be workshop for the production of devotional sculptures, its tables now flipped into barricades. Bullets ting through the many hundred stone representations of the goddess Pyr, as bodies drop on both sides. Eventually, the cultists prove too few. Having honoured the dead, you conduct a search. There is no contract, but a fiery oculus stares up from the floor, it is a Pyrphorian paper tract— an invitation to a rally at the Casado estate.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801730</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your feeble bunch finally edge open the heavy door&lt;/b&gt;, only to find the building deserted. That it is owned by the Pyrphorians there is no doubt. Carmine drapes smother the windows, and your people find themselves picking over the cult's instruments, whose purpose is unsettlingly opaque. "What's this oily liquid on the floor," someone says, just as the door slams shut, and is followed by the hasty rattle of padlock and keys. The Pyrphorian fire will burn bright and long at the quayside this night. Only one of your crew return home.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801731</GUID><Text>Find some way to sneak inside</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801732</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew stalk noiselessly around the back.&lt;/b&gt; Scaling the wall they find an open window obscured by a heavy carmine drape. Peering beyond it, they see a workshop for the production of devotional sculptures, its tables now flipped into barricades. With the cultists' attentions fixed on the main door, you are able to ambush them before it turns into a gunfight, but that doesn't stop two of your own being shot dead. Having honoured the dead, your survivors conduct a search. There is no contract, but a fiery oculus stares up from the floor, it is a Pyrphorian paper tract— an invitation to a rally at the Casado estate.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801733</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;They thought they had been quiet as church mice&lt;/b&gt;, but rounding the corner at the back of the warehouse, they have a nasty shock. Upon the balcony above, where you might have thought to gain entry to the warehouse, stands a single Pyrphorian clad in heavy garb, in his hands a long brass pipe from the aperture of which erupts a searing cone of fire. Your people spread and dive for the sea, and the Pyrphorians torch your ship. Only one of your crew return home.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801734</GUID><Text>Fan through the city, looking for clues.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801735</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your scouts pick up the scent immediately.&lt;/b&gt; "We recognised them as the fugitives from the boat we pursued, and followed them through Montoya to its outskirts. Up in the valley there is a sizeable house on a large estate. They must have taken the contract there." You set off at once.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801736</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;It seems the Pyrphorians have split.&lt;/b&gt; One you trace as far as the church, the other to a house of ill-repute— alternate refuges of the typical criminal. In neither case are the Pyrphorians still in evidence - you will have to ask one of the respective proprietors.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801737</GUID><Text>Go to the church and ask the Priest for help</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801738</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;None better than the priest&lt;/b&gt;, hidden in shadow, witness to every confession, to guide you. "Yes, the rogues were here, but they are gone now, I am powerless to stop them, like everyone else." He tells how darkness grips the Montoyan community, and their suffering pours always through his doors— a last refuge for the holy. "Many speak of a ranch, the one a little way up the valley, and a beacon, some infernal eye, that holds their wicked congregation rapt," he says. You realise if that contract is anywhere, it is probably there.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801739</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew must trust themselves to the man of god.&lt;/b&gt; After all, he seems devoted to helping you cleanse Montoya of heresy. "No, I have not seen them," he begins, "but many of my flock have lately confessed their fears— their lost faith." He smiles blithely, and leads you from the church to &lt;b&gt;a decrepit warehouse on the dock&lt;/b&gt;. "If you too wish to rid yourself of your demons, I encourage yout to begin here." Now forgive me, for I cannot abide violence," he says, taking his leave. You can try to break the warehouse door, or you can sneak around the back.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801740</GUID><Text>Go to the den of ill-repute and ask the Madam for help</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801741</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Madam is only too happy to help following such charming propitiations.&lt;/b&gt; "Yes, the devils were here. They always are." She leads you through a lanterned garden of red dahlia, and points you up the valley to a ranch. "The sort of eye you seek is up there, at the casona," she clutches her wrist suddenly, "searing, burning— The oculus." Lifting her hand she reveals a grotesque brand on her skin. Mildly troubled, you set out for the ranch. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801742</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;The Madam refuses to help without payment.&lt;/b&gt; Time is money, and your mumbling mummers are wasting it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801743</GUID><Text>Spend some time in the establishment</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801744</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;All are commendably well-behaved.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors make surprisingly good companions, all paying what they owe. "Now that I have some evidence as to your good character," says the Madam, "I will help you." She leads you through a lanterned garden of red dahlia, and points you up the valley to a ranch. "The sort of eye you seek is up there, at the casona," she clutches her wrist suddenly, "searing, burning— The oculus." Lifting her hand she reveals a grotesque brand on her skin. Thanking her for her hospitality, you set out for the ranch. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801745</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;After an hour your sailors are all over the place&lt;/b&gt;, singing and carousing, one refusing to pay for services rendered. "Get them out!" screams the Madam. "But what of the information you promised?", "Out!". You have created enough of a scene. Fortunately two boys waiting outside cheerily agree to help you for a bit of coin. They lead your band &lt;b&gt;to a warehouse&lt;/b&gt; from they claim eerie sounds emanate at night, in their words, like "stakes being driven through the hearts of vampyrs."

"The sort of eye you seek is up there, at the casona," she clutches her wrist suddenly, "searing, burning... the oculus." Lifting her hand she reveals a brand on her skin. Feeling vaguely guilty for adding to the poor woman's woes, you set out for the ranch. </Text></Text><Text><GUID>801748</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;She becomes strangely compliant&lt;/b&gt;, as if she is used to  empty aggression. "This way," she says with forced sensuality. She takes you backwards over your own steps to the dock, and gestures a silked sleeve (from which no hand protrudes) &lt;b&gt;to a decrepit-looking warehouse&lt;/b&gt;. "There. I must leave you now." The warehouse door looks breakable.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>801749</GUID><Text>&lt;b&gt;There is no sign of the Pyrphorians&lt;/b&gt;, at least not that any of your twits see. Giving up their search, they begin stopping locals in the street. Most shake them off and walk on in a hurry. But they finally seem to strike lucky when two boys cheerily agree to help for a bit of coin.

There is even an adjoining orangery, that extends naturally towards the neat parterres of its sweet-smelling garden. An arc of white gravel serves as a drive, and long lines of equally white picket border the whole acreage in typical colonial style. Indeed were it not for the unusual height of this perimeter, and the shelters abutting it at intervals— armed guards no doubt stationed in each— it would appear as any other estate.

In one, she stands beneath a dark and cosmic sky, disciples at her feet, each holding a braid of her flaming hair.

I'm Hannah, your general advisor. I have some experience in building a company, which I'll share gracefully once you will have settled an island.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>264953</GUID><Text>We are in the middle of the sea right now. We need to settle an island to build our company. Find a huge island, that possesses all fertilities required for a good start.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>264954</GUID><Text>We have our place now! Not bad, but it's only the beginning.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>264948</GUID><Text>Hello! I'm Hannah, your general advisor. Welcome to your new home! This island will witness the beginning of our company, and I'll accompany you in this project.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>264955</GUID><Text>Yes, the island looks great, but don't waste more time. Start now with our company town. You need to build a settlement to attract some farmers. They will work in basic food and goods production.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>264956</GUID><Text>Our small company city is buzzing. Farmers are flooding in the houses. They will keep gathering the core resources and goods we need.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>264930</GUID><Text>Our planks stock reduces dangerously. We shall start producing our own construction materials now...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>264931</GUID><Text>I love the scent of freshly cut wood, smells like a soon growing settlement. Very good.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>264961</GUID><Text>I heard some complaints from the employees. They refuse to live in houses because they would not have any marketplace in the area. Please fix this situation!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>264962</GUID><Text>Finally fixed. A market is the center of our city. Please remember it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>264963</GUID><Text>One of our production buildings is not able to deliver its goods anywhere. There should be a warehouse near every production area.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>264964</GUID><Text>Organizing efficiently our production areas can bring us far. I'm glad the issue is fixed now.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>265093</GUID><Text>Our delivery driver complained that he can't access the Trading Post.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>265094</GUID><Text>A good infrastructure is crucial to our success. Good that you improved it.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>264965</GUID><Text>The growth of our village triggers new demands from the farmers. Make sure to provide basic food and commodities to them, or they will leave us.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>264966</GUID><Text>Fish does not smell good, but it does please our farmers. At least the view of the fish cargo delights me: it means more workforce, ultimately.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>264967</GUID><Text>Our employees now are asking for schnapps. They would pay a lot for it, but this is no life requirement. They will just be a bit unhappy, that's all...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>265013</GUID><Text>Well said! We have to focus on growth, not on comfort!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>265015</GUID><Text>What a waste of hands... Efficient companies don't spend time on such commodities.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>265044</GUID><Text>How do you want farms to grow and raise anything? We need agricultural fields!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>265045</GUID><Text>This scenery is so rustic. It really alters from the civilized cities. But well, our farmers have some occupation now!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>265046</GUID><Text>I can already feel it... It's like in my dreams. Fire ravaging the city. It should not be complicated to have a fire station, or is it?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>265047</GUID><Text>One is better than nothing, but I would feel safer if we had even more fire stations. But I should not ask too much of you...</Text></Text><Text><GUID>265048</GUID><Text>Those houses are really too rustic... Would you mind making some renovation works?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>265049</GUID><Text>Better housing means more qualified employees. With these workers, we will industrialize our settlement! Factory work is waiting!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>265052</GUID><Text>Since each production building requires a specific workforce, make sure you have enough of each when you upgrade your houses. We still need some farmers.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>266038</GUID><Text>We are in the middle of the sea right now. We need to stand on firm ground.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>266039</GUID><Text>"A very decent island we have! But start roll up your sleeves. Our employees won't work without a decent housing."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>266040</GUID><Text>That's a good start. We can grow even further, if we provide our employees with basic needs and better housing!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>265683</GUID><Text>Some of our farmers increased their skills and can now work in factories. We can start to industrialize our production!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>266041</GUID><Text>Our industry is running, but the revolt starts to brew and the complaints are lining up. Security and education are our priorities now.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>266190</GUID><Text>Artisans are day dreamers, but their thirst for adventures could become very lucrative!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>266191</GUID><Text>This whole new land has plentiful of products to offer. Our artisans will soon acquire the taste and skills of high society!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>266192</GUID><Text>Our employees mastered the craft of electricity at the university. Modernity is at our door now.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>266193</GUID><Text>We're finally here. Our engineers can craft the most luxurious products. We would become very prosperous.</Text></Text><Text><GUID>266194</GUID><Text>I've never seen so much luxury ever before. We could start a big project where our investors would know how to spend their money?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>266195</GUID><Text>Our monument is glorious. Imagine how many people would come to visit a great exhibition, and what marvels we could discover!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>266196</GUID><Text>We're at the top of the world now. Well done!</Text></Text><Text><GUID>266036</GUID><Text>"Numbers, statistics, reports. What might be a worry to you is my affairs! I'll stay close to you just in case you need support."</Text></Text><Text><GUID>266140</GUID><Text>Those houses are really too rustic... Would you mind making some renovation works?</Text></Text><Text><GUID>265678</GUID><Text>Certain traders are installed in the area.
